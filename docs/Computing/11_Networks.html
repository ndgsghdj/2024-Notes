<h1 id="computer-network">Computer Network</h1>
<p>A computer network is a system of two or more computers (or devices)
that are connected together by a transmission medium for the exchange of
data.</p>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Resources</strong>
<ul>
<li>A network allows a group of computers to make use of shared
resources such as printers or files</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shared Internet Access</strong>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the networkâ€™s configuration, every user who logs on to
the network may have access to the internet</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shared software: Software</strong>
<ul>
<li>Can be stored on the central server of a network and deployed to
other computers over a network</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shared Storage</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data files can be stored on a central server for ease of access and
backup purposes</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>
<ul>
<li>Computers in the same network are often able to share instant
messages and emails for communication</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initial Costs
<ul>
<li>Installing a network could be costly due to the high setup and
equipment costs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maintenance Costs
<ul>
<li>There are also subsequent costs associated with administering and
maintaining the network</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Security Risks
<ul>
<li>As files are shared through a network, there is the risk of virus or
worm attacks spreading throughout the network even with just one
infected computer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Risk of data loss
<ul>
<li>Data may just become lost due to hardware failures or errors. Using
a network means regular data backups are needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Server outage
<ul>
<li>If the server fails, the network will not be able to function, thus
affecting work processes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="types-of-computer-networks">Types of Computer Networks</h1>
<h2 id="geographical-location">Geographical Location</h2>
<ul>
<li>Local Area Network (LAN) - Network of connecting devices connected
within a small geographical area, typically within the same building,
such as a home, school or office.</li>
<li>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) - Network of computing devices
typically spanning across two or more buildings within the same</li>
<li>Wide Area Network (WAN) - Network of computing devices covering a
large-scale geographical area, typically across multiple geographical
locations.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="network-protocols">Network Protocols</h1>
<p>Set of standards and rules that govern how two or more devices
communicate over a network.</p>
<p>OSI stands for <strong>Open Systems Interconnection</strong>. The OSI
model is a conceptual model created by the International Organisation
for Standardisation which enables diverse communication to communicate
using standard protocols.</p>
<p>The OSI model does not perform any functions in the networking
process. It divides network communication into seven layers. The OSI
Model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. It is
based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven
abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.</p>
<p><strong>Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)</strong>. In this model,
layers 1-4 are considered the lower layers and mostly concern themselves
with moving data around.</p>
<p>Layers 5-7 called the upper layers, contain application-level data.
It's basically 7 layers of Networking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>All People Seem To Need Data Processing</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="osi-physical-layer">OSI Physical Layer</h1>
<p>The lowest layer of the OSI Model is concerned with electrically or
optically transmitting raw unstructured data bits across the network
from the physical layer of the sending device to the physical layer of
the receiving device. It can include specifications such as voltages,
pin layout, cabling, and radio frequencies. At the physical layer, one
might find "physical" resources such as network hubs, cabling,
repeaters, network adapters or modems. E.g. RS-232, RJ45, 100ASE-TX.</p>
<h1 id="osi-data-link-layer">OSI Data Link Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Physical Addressing</strong></p>
<p>At the data link layer, directly connected nodes are used to perform
node-to-node data transfer where data is packaged into frames. The data
link layer also corrects errors that may have occurred at the physical
layer.</p>
<p>The data link layer encompasses two sub-layers of its own. The first
media access control (MAC), provides flow control and multiplexing for
device transmissions over a network. The second, the logical link
control (LLC), provides flow and error control over the physical medium
as well as identifies line protocols E.g. Ethernet, 802.11, WiFi 7,
Fibre Channel, Frame Relay, Token Ring.</p>
<h1 id="osi-network-layer">OSI Network Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Path Determination and Logical Addressing</strong></p>
<p>The network layer is responsible for receiving frames from the data
link layer, and delivering them to their intended destinations among
based on the addresses contained inside the frame. The network layer
finds the destination by using logical addresses, such as IP (internet
protocol). At this layer, routers are a crucial component used to quite
literally route information where it needs to go between networks e.g.
IP, ARP, IPSEC, ICMP, IGMP, OSPF</p>
<h2 id="arp">ARP</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-arp">What is ARP?</h3>
<p>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol or procedure that
connects an ever-changing Internet Protocol (IP) address to a fixed
physical machine address, also known as a media access control (MAC)
address.</p>
<h1 id="osi-transport-layer">OSI Transport Layer</h1>
<p><strong>End to End Connection and Reliability</strong></p>
<p>The transport layer manages the delivery and error checking of data
packets. It regulates the size, sequencing, and ultimately the transfer
of data between systems and hosts. One of the most common examples of
the transport layer is TCP or the Transmission Control Protocol E.g.
TCP, UDP, SCTP, SSL, TLS.</p>
<p>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol; also known
as the internet protocol suite) is the set of protocols used over the
internet. It organises how data packets are communicated and make sure
packets have the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source</strong> - which computer the message came from.</li>
<li><strong>Destination</strong> - where the message should go</li>
<li><strong>Packet Sequence</strong> - The order the message data should
be re-assembled</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - the data of the message</li>
<li><strong>Error Check</strong> - The check to see that the message has
been sent correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Networking/figure10.png" alt="figure10" /></p>
<p>TCP/IP Protocol includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTTP</strong> - transfers web pages from web servers to the
client. All web page addresses start with http. An https address is a
secure web address which has been encrypted. An https address is used
for sites holding bank details and secure information.</li>
<li><strong>FTP</strong> - used to transfer large files. It is often
used for organising files on a web server for a website. You can have
private access to download the documents that you have shared.</li>
<li><strong>UDP</strong> - User Datagram Protocol - Similar to TCP, but
because messages are sent instead of packets - chunks - it is often
faster, allowing for gaming or video calls over the internet.</li>
<li><strong>SMTP</strong> - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - governs the
sending of emails over a network to a mail server.</li>
<li><strong>IMAP/POP3</strong> - Internet Message Access Protocol -
governs retrieving emails from email servers.</li>
<li><strong>VOIP</strong> - is a set of protocols that enables people to
have voice conversations over the internet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tcp">TCP</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slower but more reliable transfers</li>
<li>Typical Applications:
<ul>
<li>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</li>
<li>Web Browsing</li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="udp">UDP</h2>
<ul>
<li>Faster but not guaranteed transfers ("best effort")</li>
<li>Typical Applications:
<ul>
<li>Live streaming</li>
<li>Online games</li>
<li>VoIP</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./Networking/figure11.png" alt="figure11" /></p>
<p>The reason why FTP uses only TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is
that TCP provides a <strong>reliable</strong>, connection-oriented,
byte-stream service, which is ideal for transferring files.</p>
<p>Additionally, FTP uses TCP's flow control and congestion control
mechanisms to ensure that the network is not overloaded with too much
traffic.</p>
<p><img src="Networking/figure12.png" alt="figure12" /></p>
<h1 id="osi-session-layer">OSI Session Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Interhost Communication</strong></p>
<p>The session layer controls the conversations between different
computers. A session or connection between machines is set up, managed
and terminated at layer 5. Session layer services also include
authentication and reconnections. E.g. Session establishment in TCP,
SIP, RTP.</p>
<h1 id="osi-presentation-layer">OSI Presentation Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Data Representation and Communication</strong></p>
<p>The presentation layer formats or translates data for the application
layer based on the syntax or semantics that the application accepts.
Because of this, it is also at times is also called the syntax layer.
This layer can also handle the encryption and decryption required by the
application layer. E.g. HTML, DOC, JPEG, MP3, M4V, Sockets</p>
<h1 id="osi-application-layer">OSI Application Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Network process to Application</strong></p>
<p>At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact
directly with the software application. This layer sees network services
provided to end-user applications such as a web browser or Office 365.
The application layer identifies communication partners, resources
availability and synchronises communication. E.g. DNS, WWW/HTTP, P2P,
EMAIL/POP, SMTO, Telnet FTP.</p>
<p>TCP is slower but more reliable it makes sure the data is safely
passed. UDP on the other hand does not care and yeets the data hoping it
works.</p>
<p>UDP uses time-sensitive transmissions. It speeds up transmissions by
enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the
receiving party. Basically 2fast4u.</p>
<h1 id="transmission-mediums">Transmission Mediums</h1>
<p>A <strong>wired network</strong> is a network of devices connected by
a physical medium, such as cables. The Ethernet is the most widely used
wired network protocol in LANs and MANs.</p>
<p><img src="Networking/figure1.png" alt="figure1" /></p>
<p>A <strong>wireless network</strong> is a network of devices in which
signals are transmitted without the use of a physical medium. The most
common wireless network protocol is Wi-Fi, which uses radio waves to
transmit data.</p>
<p>A <strong>Wireless Access Point</strong> (WAP) is a network device
that provides a connection between wireless devices up to 100 metres
away and can connect to wired networks.</p>

<h1 id="computer-network-1">Computer Network</h1>
<p>A computer network is a system of two or more computers (or devices)
that are connected together by a transmission medium for the exchange of
data.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-3">Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Resources</strong>
<ul>
<li>A network allows a group of computers to make use of shared
resources such as printers or files</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shared Internet Access</strong>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the networkâ€™s configuration, every user who logs on to
the network may have access to the internet</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shared software: Software</strong>
<ul>
<li>Can be stored on the central server of a network and deployed to
other computers over a network</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shared Storage</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data files can be stored on a central server for ease of access and
backup purposes</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>
<ul>
<li>Computers in the same network are often able to share instant
messages and emails for communication</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disadvantages-3">Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initial Costs
<ul>
<li>Installing a network could be costly due to the high setup and
equipment costs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maintenance Costs
<ul>
<li>There are also subsequent costs associated with administering and
maintaining the network</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Security Risks
<ul>
<li>As files are shared through a network, there is the risk of virus or
worm attacks spreading throughout the network even with just one
infected computer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Risk of data loss
<ul>
<li>Data may just become lost due to hardware failures or errors. Using
a network means regular data backups are needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Server outage
<ul>
<li>If the server fails, the network will not be able to function, thus
affecting work processes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="types-of-computer-networks-1">Types of Computer Networks</h1>
<h2 id="geographical-location-1">Geographical Location</h2>
<ul>
<li>Local Area Network (LAN) - Network of connecting devices connected
within a small geographical area, typically within the same building,
such as a home, school or office.</li>
<li>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) - Network of computing devices
typically spanning across two or more buildings within the same</li>
<li>Wide Area Network (WAN) - Network of computing devices covering a
large-scale geographical area, typically across multiple geographical
locations.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="network-protocols-1">Network Protocols</h1>
<p>Set of standards and rules that govern how two or more devices
communicate over a network.</p>
<p>OSI stands for <strong>Open Systems Interconnection</strong>. The OSI
model is a conceptual model created by the International Organisation
for Standardisation which enables diverse communication to communicate
using standard protocols.</p>
<p>The OSI model does not perform any functions in the networking
process. It divides network communication into seven layers. The OSI
Model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. It is
based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven
abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.</p>
<p><strong>Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)</strong>. In this model,
layers 1-4 are considered the lower layers and mostly concern themselves
with moving data around.</p>
<p>Layers 5-7 called the upper layers, contain application-level data.
It's basically 7 layers of Networking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>All People Seem To Need Data Processing</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="osi-physical-layer-1">OSI Physical Layer</h1>
<p>The lowest layer of the OSI Model is concerned with electrically or
optically transmitting raw unstructured data bits across the network
from the physical layer of the sending device to the physical layer of
the receiving device. It can include specifications such as voltages,
pin layout, cabling, and radio frequencies. At the physical layer, one
might find "physical" resources such as network hubs, cabling,
repeaters, network adapters or modems. E.g. RS-232, RJ45, 100ASE-TX.</p>
<h1 id="osi-data-link-layer-1">OSI Data Link Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Physical Addressing</strong></p>
<p>At the data link layer, directly connected nodes are used to perform
node-to-node data transfer where data is packaged into frames. The data
link layer also corrects errors that may have occurred at the physical
layer.</p>
<p>The data link layer encompasses two sub-layers of its own. The first
media access control (MAC), provides flow control and multiplexing for
device transmissions over a network. The second, the logical link
control (LLC), provides flow and error control over the physical medium
as well as identifies line protocols E.g. Ethernet, 802.11, WiFi 7,
Fibre Channel, Frame Relay, Token Ring.</p>
<h1 id="osi-network-layer-1">OSI Network Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Path Determination and Logical Addressing</strong></p>
<p>The network layer is responsible for receiving frames from the data
link layer, and delivering them to their intended destinations among
based on the addresses contained inside the frame. The network layer
finds the destination by using logical addresses, such as IP (internet
protocol). At this layer, routers are a crucial component used to quite
literally route information where it needs to go between networks e.g.
IP, ARP, IPSEC, ICMP, IGMP, OSPF</p>
<h2 id="arp-1">ARP</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-arp-1">What is ARP?</h3>
<p>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol or procedure that
connects an ever-changing Internet Protocol (IP) address to a fixed
physical machine address, also known as a media access control (MAC)
address.</p>
<h1 id="osi-transport-layer-1">OSI Transport Layer</h1>
<p><strong>End to End Connection and Reliability</strong></p>
<p>The transport layer manages the delivery and error checking of data
packets. It regulates the size, sequencing, and ultimately the transfer
of data between systems and hosts. One of the most common examples of
the transport layer is TCP or the Transmission Control Protocol E.g.
TCP, UDP, SCTP, SSL, TLS.</p>
<p>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol; also known
as the internet protocol suite) is the set of protocols used over the
internet. It organises how data packets are communicated and make sure
packets have the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source</strong> - which computer the message came from.</li>
<li><strong>Destination</strong> - where the message should go</li>
<li><strong>Packet Sequence</strong> - The order the message data should
be re-assembled</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - the data of the message</li>
<li><strong>Error Check</strong> - The check to see that the message has
been sent correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Networking/figure10.png" alt="figure10" /></p>
<p>TCP/IP Protocol includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTTP</strong> - transfers web pages from web servers to the
client. All web page addresses start with http. An https address is a
secure web address which has been encrypted. An https address is used
for sites holding bank details and secure information.</li>
<li><strong>FTP</strong> - used to transfer large files. It is often
used for organising files on a web server for a website. You can have
private access to download the documents that you have shared.</li>
<li><strong>UDP</strong> - User Datagram Protocol - Similar to TCP, but
because messages are sent instead of packets - chunks - it is often
faster, allowing for gaming or video calls over the internet.</li>
<li><strong>SMTP</strong> - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - governs the
sending of emails over a network to a mail server.</li>
<li><strong>IMAP/POP3</strong> - Internet Message Access Protocol -
governs retrieving emails from email servers.</li>
<li><strong>VOIP</strong> - is a set of protocols that enables people to
have voice conversations over the internet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tcp-1">TCP</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slower but more reliable transfers</li>
<li>Typical Applications:
<ul>
<li>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</li>
<li>Web Browsing</li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="udp-1">UDP</h2>
<ul>
<li>Faster but not guaranteed transfers ("best effort")</li>
<li>Typical Applications:
<ul>
<li>Live streaming</li>
<li>Online games</li>
<li>VoIP</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./Networking/figure11.png" alt="figure11" /></p>
<p>The reason why FTP uses only TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is
that TCP provides a <strong>reliable</strong>, connection-oriented,
byte-stream service, which is ideal for transferring files.</p>
<p>Additionally, FTP uses TCP's flow control and congestion control
mechanisms to ensure that the network is not overloaded with too much
traffic.</p>
<p><img src="Networking/figure12.png" alt="figure12" /></p>
<h1 id="osi-session-layer-1">OSI Session Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Interhost Communication</strong></p>
<p>The session layer controls the conversations between different
computers. A session or connection between machines is set up, managed
and terminated at layer 5. Session layer services also include
authentication and reconnections. E.g. Session establishment in TCP,
SIP, RTP.</p>
<h1 id="osi-presentation-layer-1">OSI Presentation Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Data Representation and Communication</strong></p>
<p>The presentation layer formats or translates data for the application
layer based on the syntax or semantics that the application accepts.
Because of this, it is also at times is also called the syntax layer.
This layer can also handle the encryption and decryption required by the
application layer. E.g. HTML, DOC, JPEG, MP3, M4V, Sockets</p>
<h1 id="osi-application-layer-1">OSI Application Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Network process to Application</strong></p>
<p>At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact
directly with the software application. This layer sees network services
provided to end-user applications such as a web browser or Office 365.
The application layer identifies communication partners, resources
availability and synchronises communication. E.g. DNS, WWW/HTTP, P2P,
EMAIL/POP, SMTO, Telnet FTP.</p>
<p>TCP is slower but more reliable it makes sure the data is safely
passed. UDP on the other hand does not care and yeets the data hoping it
works.</p>
<p>UDP uses time-sensitive transmissions. It speeds up transmissions by
enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the
receiving party. Basically 2fast4u.</p>
<h1 id="transmission-mediums-1">Transmission Mediums</h1>
<p>A <strong>wired network</strong> is a network of devices connected by
a physical medium, such as cables. The Ethernet is the most widely used
wired network protocol in LANs and MANs.</p>
<p><img src="Networking/figure1.png" alt="figure1" /></p>
<p>A <strong>wireless network</strong> is a network of devices in which
signals are transmitted without the use of a physical medium. The most
common wireless network protocol is Wi-Fi, which uses radio waves to
transmit data.</p>
<p>A <strong>Wireless Access Point</strong> (WAP) is a network device
that provides a connection between wireless devices up to 100 metres
away and can connect to wired networks.</p>
