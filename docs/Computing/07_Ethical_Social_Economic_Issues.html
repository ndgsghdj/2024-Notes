<h2 id="data-corruption">Data Corruption</h2>
<p><strong>Data corruption</strong> occurs when computer data is made
unstable by errors or alterations. This can happen during the reading,
writing or transmission of data.</p>
<p>If the corrupted data cannot be recovered / replaced, this results in
<strong>data loss</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="effects-of-corruption-and-data-loss">Effects of Corruption and
Data Loss</h3>
<p>The effects vary depending on the amount of corrupted data and type
of data that is represented.</p>
<p>If the corrupted data is not needed to read other data, only that
data itself is lost. This is more likely if the amount of corrupted data
is small.</p>
<p>However, if the corrupted data is related to other data in the
computer, then both itself and its related data may be lost, as it may
contain information required to read/interpret the related data. This is
more likely if the amount of corrupted data is large.</p>
<h3 id="causes-and-ways-to-prevent-data-corruption-and-loss">Causes and
Ways to Prevent Data Corruption and Loss</h3>
<p>In all cases, making regular <strong>backups</strong> (copies of data
made in case the original data is damaged or lost) of data will help to
prevent the loss of data.</p>
<p>Causes of data corruption and loss include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Human Error</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Storage devices may be damaged during transport.</li>
<li>Multiple users working on the same file may accidentally overwrite
each other.</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>
<ul>
<li>Make regular backups of data</li>
<li>Use adequate protection when transporting storage devices.</li>
<li>Set up rules when collaborating with multiple users to prevent them
from writing to the same file at the same time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Power Failure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the power supply to a computer fails, data in the process of
being written to a storage device may become corrupted and data stored
in volatile memory and not yet written to a storage device will become
lost.</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>
<ul>
<li>Regular backups</li>
<li>Set up a backup power supply, or <strong>uninterruptible power
supply (UPS)</strong> so storage devices can complete any write
operations in case of a power failure.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Hardware Failure/Damage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All magnetic, optical and solid-state storage devices can fail,
either due to overuse, manufacturing defects, or age.</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>
<ul>
<li>Regular backups</li>
<li>Check storage device regularly and replace them immediately when
signs of failure are detected.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Malware/viruses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some malware may purposely damage and corrupt data as a way of
attacking the computer</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>
<ul>
<li>Regular backups</li>
<li>Avoid opening emails/attachments or files from unknown sources.</li>
<li>Install and configure a firewall to prevent malware from spreading
through the network.</li>
<li>Install anti-virus and anti-spyware software and perform regular
scans and updates</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>An <strong>uninterruptible power supply</strong> is a device that
provides enough emergency power for a computer to properly shut down in
the event of a power failure.</p>
<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It
requires the user to prove their identity by providing evidence from one
or more of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something the user knows (password)</li>
<li>Something the user owns (mobile phone)</li>
<li>Something physically unique about the user (thumbprint)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category of evidence used for authentication is called an
<strong>authentication factor</strong></p>
<h3 id="passwords">Passwords</h3>
<p>Passwords are the most common form of authentication. Some passwords
are entered together with a username that identifies who the user claims
to be.</p>
<p>They can be a poor form of authentication if they are chosen poorly
or not well-kept as a secret. Avoid using birthdates, surnames and other
things that can be easily guessed.</p>
<p>Use hard to guess passwords that are a mixture of lowercase,
uppercase letters, numbers and symbols.</p>
<p>Avoid re-using passwords or leaving them unchanged for a long time as
it makes it easier for an intruder to guess the password. Use unique
passwords for each computer and account, and update them at least once
every 90 days.</p>
<h3 id="unauthorised-access">Unauthorised Access</h3>
<p>Some authentication systems require evidence from more than 1
authentication factor. Banks typically issue a device called a security
token to users who wish to access their accounts online.</p>
<p>A <strong>security token</strong> is a device used specifically for
authentication purposes, such as mobile phones and one-time passwords
(OTPs).</p>
<p>The type of authentication that uses evidence from both something a
user knows and owns is called <strong>2-factor
authentication</strong>.</p>
<p>2FA is stronger than a singular password as it is more difficult for
an intruder to both guess a password and steal the user’s security
token. Hence, it is important to keep the security token in a secure
location at all times and to report a missing security token as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>If an OTP is sent wirelessly to a user’s mobile phone, it may be
intercepted and used by an intruder during the transmission process. If
the secret algorithm used to generate OTPs is poorly chosen or
accidentally revealed, an intruder may find out how to generate OTPs
without needing the security token at all.</p>
<p>There is not much a user can do about this type of intrusion
attempt.</p>
<h3 id="biometrics">Biometrics</h3>
<p><strong>Biometrics</strong> is a type of authentication that is based
on the measurement of human physical characteristics.</p>
<p>For example, biometrics is used to identify a user by fingerprint or
voice. Other characteristics used include the face, iris, retina, and
DNA.</p>
<p>The use of biometric identification is more secure as the physical
characteristics measured are typically unique to the individual and
cannot be easily replicated. Thus, it helps prevent attempts to
establish fraudulent identities and <strong>identity theft</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Identity theft</strong> is the impersonation of another
person to steal personal details such as name and identity number for
fraudulent purposes.</p>
<h2 id="authorisation">Authorisation</h2>
<p>Once the user is authenticated, the ability of a computer to control
the access of data and resources by that user is called <strong>access
control/authorisation</strong>.</p>
<p>Computers provide access control through a variety of means.</p>
<h3 id="file-permissions">File Permissions</h3>
<p>Most operating systems have settings to control the ability of users
to view or make changes to specific files or folders. These settings are
called <strong>permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>An application of file permissions is when a teacher may set a
presentation file to be read-only for students, so they do not
accidentally (or intentionally) change its contents.</p>
<p>Typically, users can only change the permissions for any file or
folder they own. However, most OS's allow for a special user called the
<strong>administrator</strong>, who can override the permissions for
almost any file or folder.</p>
<p>A normal user may also be given special <strong>administrator
rights</strong> that allow them to override the permissions for certain
files or folders, just like an administrator.</p>
<p>Managing permissions and administrative rights can be a complex task,
and it is possible to accidentally grant access to a file or
administrative rights to an unauthorised user. Such a user can then make
use of such mistakes to gain unauthorised access to data and
resources.</p>
<p>Authentication for the administrator must be especially strong, as an
intruder that successfully claims to be an administrator can bypass file
permissions entirely.</p>
<p>File permissions do not prevent an intruder with physical access to a
storage device from accessing files or folders directly without going
through the operating system. To prevent such access, it is necessary to
use encryption.</p>
<p>File permissions can be used as access control for both computers
connected to a network and computers that are not connected to a
network, but are shared by multiple users.</p>
<h3 id="firewalls">Firewalls</h3>
<p>Computers connected to a network are naturally more susceptible to
intrusion as unauthorised access can occur without the physical presence
of an intruder.</p>
<p>Hence, computers connected to a network usually require another layer
of access control called a <strong>firewall</strong></p>
<p>A firewall is a device/network that prevents unauthorised access to
or from a private network. It works by monitoring each piece of data
transmitted through a network. It then either blocks or allows data to
pass based on a set of rules configured by an administrator.</p>
<p>When properly configured, a firewall can protect computers within a
network from unauthorised access. They can be configured to block the
transmission of data (aka <strong>traffic</strong>) between unauthorised
senders and receivers, especially requests for data from anonymous users
on the internet. This prevents intruders from gaining access to the
computers within a network.</p>
<p>Since firewalls can also block traffic based on the type of
application that is transmitting the data, it can also stop certain
harmful programs from sending copies of themselves to other computers
through the network.</p>
<p>Configuring a firewall correctly can be complex and a misconfigured
firewall may have security vulnerabilities that allows intruders to gain
unauthorised access.</p>
<p>A properly configured firewall allows for a private network (aka
<strong>intranet</strong>) to be set up such that all external traffic
is blocked and only authenticated and authorised users are able to
access it. Since the users on a private network are generally trusted
and expected to keep information on the network confidential, there are
usually fewer concerns about unauthorised access when sharing data on a
private network.</p>
<p>Conversely, a private network such as the Internet allows anyone to
connect to it and share data. Since public networks have little-to-no
restrictions, users need to be wary of possible security and privacy
risks when accessing it.</p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p><strong>Encryption</strong> is the process of encoding data so that a
secret key is required to read the data. Like passwords, the secret key
is usually provided as a sequence of bytes.</p>
<p>Before the encrypted data is decoded using the secret key, it appears
as random and meaningless data.</p>
<p>Encryption is often used to protect data from unauthorised access by
allowing only authorised users to have the secret key. It can be used in
combination with file permissions so an unauthorised user who bypasses
file permissions would still be unable to use the accessed data without
knowing the secret key.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-of-privacy-policies">Understanding of Privacy
Policies</h2>
<p>Unauthorised access can occur indirectly due to the actions of
3rd-party users or services.</p>
<p>For example, a user alters file permissions to let a classmate access
some private files. That classmate in turn shares those files with
others without the original user's knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - The ability to keep specific data or
resources from being known by others.
<ul>
<li>In many countries, organisations are required by law to publicise or
make available a privacy policy about the rules and practices they
follow regarding the collection, protection and use of personal or
private data provided by users.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Organisations in Singapore are required by
the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) to make their privacy policies
available upon request.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>An increasing number of users share personal information such as
photos and location data using online services, many of them are
unfamiliar with the relevant privacy policies or how such sharing habits
may indirectly result in unauthorised access. A poor understanding of
the privacy policies of these services can often result in unauthorised
access.</p>
<h3 id="social-networking-sites">Social Networking Sites</h3>
<p>Social networking sites such as Twitter, Instagram and TikTok allow
users to share photographs and information quickly with their families
or friends. They can also be used to promote businesses or raise
awareness of campaigns or causes.</p>
<p>However, these sites can pose many privacy concerns because most
users do not read or consider the repercussions of the privacy policies
used by these sites regarding personal information such as status
updates, notes, photographs and location data.</p>
<p>The privacy policies for many social networking sites do not
guarantee that personal data collected will never be exposed to
unauthorised users and may even require that your personal data be
shared with advertisers in order to use their sites. Hence, personal
data can potentially be harvested for spam and other threats to privacy
that users did not authorise directly.</p>
<p>Remember: Once data is digitised and uploaded to a public network
such as the Internet, it can potentially remain there forever, since it
can be easily copied and republished in ways no longer under the control
of the original uploader.</p>
<p>Oh, and also some privacy policies for some social networking sites
don’t guarantee that their personal data will be deleted from the site
completely or immediately even after their account is closed, deleted,
or has all personal data removed from it.</p>
<p>Personal data is sensitive and should not be shared publicly. Some
companies may reject candidates after reviewing the information and
photographs posted on their social networking accounts, even if this was
posted while they were still at school.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<h3 id="preventing-unauthorised-access">Preventing Unauthorised
Access</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read and fully understand the privacy policy of the social
networking site.</li>
<li>Set sharing settings to "private" so only people you know in real
life can read your posts.</li>
<li>Think twice before posting personal photographs or information that
you may feel uncomfortable sharing.</li>
<li>Accept friend requests wisely. Make sure you know everyone in your
friends list.</li>

Measures Against Privacy and Security Threats</h3>
<h4 id="installing-anti-virus-and-anti-spyware-programs">Installing
anti-virus and anti-spyware programs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-Spyware</strong> - Software to detect, remove and stop
spyware and other malware from running.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-virus</strong> - Software to detect, remove and stop
viruses and other malware from running.</li>
</ul>
<p>Counters viruses, worms, spyware and Trojan horses, since they need
to run on a user's computer in order to perform their respective
attacks.</p>
<p>These programs can be used to scan a user's storage and email to
detect and remove malware. If a program has been infected by a virus, it
may also try to restore the original program.</p>
<p>Although powerful, most rely on a list of
<strong>signatures</strong>, unique evidence used to detect a known
version of some malicious software. This list has to be updated
regularly to ensure protection provided continues to be effective
against new malware. Most programs update the list automatically through
the Internet.</p>
<p>Some especially devious Trojan horses appear to be anti-virus and
anti-spyware programs. Only trust programs provided by reputable
companies, or as part of the computer's <strong>operating
system</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="operating-system">Operating System</h3>
<p>An <strong>operating system</strong> is software designed to support
a computer's basic functions, such as Windows and MacOS.</p>
<h3 id="update-software-regularly">Update Software Regularly</h3>
<p>Most malware require human interaction to activate, but worms can run
automatically by exploiting bugs in otherwise legitimate programs
already running on a computer.</p>
<p>For example, a flawed web browser may have a bug that allows websites
to run malicious programs without the user's knowledge.</p>
<p>To prevent this, update software regularly so bugs that were
discovered since the last update can be fixed. This is especially
important for software used to interact with public networks like the
Internet, as data from public networks is more likely to be malicious
and designed to take advantage of known bugs.</p>
<h3 id="identity-phishing">Identity Phishing</h3>
<p>Phishing emails should be ignored and deleted. There are several
telltale signs to identify phishing emails.</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims to be from a company/bank asking for confidential
information. Most companies and banks never ask for such information via
email. If in doubt, call the company or bank to verify.</li>
<li>Generic greeting such as "Dear User", it is a sign that the email
was sent automatically and not by a person.</li>
<li>Inaccurate logos and grammatical or spelling errors.</li>
<li>Sender's email address or contact does not match the supposed source
of email.</li>
<li>Email has hyperlinks with destinations that do not match what the
hyperlink text says or is otherwise unexpected. Place mouse cursor over
the hyperlink and its destination should appear as a popup or on the
status bar.</li>
<li>Excessively urgent or threatening tone, a scare tactic to make
victims act before they can think through their actions properly.</li>
<li>Email promises offers that are too good to be true, tempting victims
into revealing personal information.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identity-pharming">Identity Pharming</h3>
<p>Pharming is like phishing V2. The attacker attempts to intercept
requests sent from a computer to a legitimate website and redirects the
user to a fake website to steal personal data.</p>
<p>For example, a victim of pharming may log into their bank account,
and are presented with a website that looks like the bank, but isn't.
The attacker can now retrieve your account details to access your bank
account on the actual website, stealing your money.</p>
<p>For pharming to be successful, the attacker must either have malware
running on the victim's computer or has taken control of a network
device such as a router or server. This can occur as the software that
runs on such devices is also susceptible to bugs.</p>
<p>It is harder to detect as everything seems to be normal while the
attack takes place. Measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure encryption is used when submitting sensitive information via
the internet. Check if there's a padlock icon at the address bar.</li>
<li>Regularly check bank, debit/credit card and other statements to
ensure all transactions are legitimate.</li>
<li>Regularly update web browsers and the software running on the
network hardware so that all known bugs are fixed.</li>
<li>Enable 2FA for all bank transactions. This means even if the
attacker is able to access the bank account, no unauthorised
transactions can occur as the attacker would not be able to provide the
required OTP.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="manage-spam">Manage Spam</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid giving your email to unfamiliar contacts or untrusted
websites. If you really need to provide one, use a temporary email
generator like 10minutemail. Or, set up a secondary email address
dedicated to unimportant emails.</li>
<li>Read and understand the privacy policy of any website, trusted or
untrusted, that requests an email address before providing it. Some
websites share email addresses with advertisers who spam.</li>
<li>Look for options to disable email update or participation in mailing
lists when signing up or changing online account settings.</li>
<li>Most email services have a filter feature that allow users to block
specific senders or to only allow emails from specific senders through.
<ul>
<li>Some filtering systems have advanced spam detection algorithms that
can be trained by having the user identify examples of spam the filter
is not yet able to detect. This lets the filter become more effective in
detecting spam over time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="manage-cookies">Manage Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the web browser when a
user visits a website. Each time a user visits a website that uses
cookies, the browser checks whether it has a relevant cookie and if so,
it sends the information contained in that cookie back to the
website.</p>
<p>The website is thus aware that that the user has visited before and
sometimes customises what appears on the page for the user. If no
relevant cookie is found, the website may request for a new cookie to be
created.</p>
<p>They are generally not malicious and are needed to keep track of
authentication information to identify which user is currently logged
in. However, they can be used to keep track of user movements and
preferences within the websites, such as which pages are most recently
visited. Advertising companies with advertisements on multiple websites
can also use cookies to keep track of users as they move from one
website to another.</p>
<p>Most browsers have settings that allow users to manually delete or
prevent cookies from being created by untrusted websites. These settings
can also be configured to disable cookies or allow only selected
websites to use cookies.</p>
<h2 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property</strong> - Creations of the mind that
have value but can exist purely as data with no physical form.</li>
<li><strong>Copyright</strong> - The legal right of owners to control
the use and distribution of their intellectual property.</li>
<li><strong>License</strong> - Official description of activities that
are authorised or forbidden by the owner of intellectual property.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-software-licenses">Types of Software Licenses</h3>
<p>There are several types of software licenses in order to avoid
infringing copyright laws.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Public Domain Software</strong> - Software where the
legal protections that are typically granted to intellectual property
have either expired, surrendered or are simply inapplicable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not protected by copyright, anybody can legally copy, modify and
distribute public domain software. It may not always come with source
code, though most do.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)</strong> - Software
where users are given freedom to change, copy, study and share the
software and its source code.</p>
<ul>
<li>The term "free" refers to free to use, not free of charge.</li>
<li>Similar to public domain software, but is still protected under
copyright and the copyright owners may use this protection to require
that the software must always be distributed with source code,
attribution to the original authors must be provided or any
modifications must use a similar license if distributed.</li>
<li>Other types of copyrighted works such as books, photographs and
music must be licensed in a similar manner using Creative Commons (CC)
licenses. Note that CC licenses grant users freedom to copy, modify and
distribute copyrighted works, CC licenses are not designed for software
and should not be used for this purpose. It can, however, be used to
license content that is delivered using software. Higher education
course materials such as videos and notes created by universities and
distributed for free on the Internet, aka <strong>open
courseware</strong> often use CC licenses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Courseware</strong> - Higher-education course
materials such as videos and notes created by universities and
distributed for free on the Internet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proprietary Software</strong> - Commercial software for
which most of the legal protections under copyright are retained.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike FOSS, it is usually not legal to copy, modify or distribute
proprietary software. The terms and conditions for which the proprietary
software may or may not be used under copyright protection law are
usually communicated by users through an End User License Agreement
(EULA) contract that the user must accept to use the software.</li>
<li>The source code for proprietary software is usually kept
secret.</li>
<li>Although it seems super restrictive compared to FOSS, it is
important to remember that software is a form of intellectual property
and it is the right of the owner to be compensated for the use of the
property. An example of proprietary software is Windows OS, where
unauthorised copying is illegal and the majority of source code is kept
secret.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Freeware</strong> - Proprietary software that is
available for use at no cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some freeware are "lite" versions of proprietary software, allowing
users to try a limited version of the software while promoting the full
version</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Shareware</strong> - Demonstration software that is
distributed for free but a specific evaluation period only.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the evaluation period, the program expires and the user can no
longer access the program unless the user pays a registration fee.</li>
<li>The source code for freeware and shareware is usually kept secret
and modifying the software is usually kept illegal. However, it may be
legal to copy and distribute freeware and shareware. Adobe Reader and
Skype are examples of freeware, and Camtasia Studio and WinRAR are
examples of shareware.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software-piracy">Software Piracy</h3>
<p><strong>Software piracy</strong> is the crime of copying,
distributing or using proprietary software illegally. Despite being
illegal, it is prevalent and can take place in many forms.</p>
<p>Installing multiple copies of proprietary software without purchasing
additional licenses or sharing proprietary software with unlicensed
users is considered software piracy and can result in similar legal
repercussions.</p>
<p>Software piracy causes significant loss of revenue for the owners of
intellectual property, which leads to higher prices for legitimate
buyers.</p>
<p><strong>Cracks</strong> are programs that modify proprietary software
so that the software cannot detect that it is being used illegally.
Software piracy is an example of <strong>copyright
infringement</strong>, which is the use or distribution of copyrighted
work without the permission of the copyright owner. While software
piracy is specific to software, copyright infringement can occur for any
copyrighted materials, such as pictures on the Internet, which is
equivalent to theft.</p>
<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>
<p><strong>Plagiarism</strong> is the act of passing off someone else's
original work as your own, aka the act of claiming to be the author of a
piece of work without providing proper credit or attribution to the
actual author.</p>
<p>Unlike copyright infringement, plagiarism may not always be illegal,
but it is nevertheless an act of dishonesty and is usually a punishable
offense in academia.</p>
<p>Plagiarism can still occur when the original owner of a piece of work
consents to letting someone use it as their own.</p>
<p>To avoid plagiarism, you can use <strong>citations</strong> to give
proper credit to the original authors of any reproduced materials in
published books, websites and articles.</p>
<h2 id="impact-of-technology-on-daily-life">Impact of Technology on
Daily Life</h2>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>The Internet has enabled diverse cultures to interact and share ideas
with each other. Social networking sites have enabled users to remain
connected with friends, family and colleagues over long distances.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence has made it possible for anyone to
automatically transcribe and translate speech into different languages
with high speed and accuracy.</p>
<p>Some people on the Internet use the Internet to reinforce their
existing opinions, or to spread the rumors, misinformation, or
propaganda. This is worsened by the use of AI by some news and social
and media sites to promote content the reader is likely to be interested
in. Most sites promote content based on engagement and not accuracy.</p>
<p>Smart phones have led to an increased focus on mobile devices and
mobile applications in the computing industry.</p>
<p>Social media has led to increased use of social media for marketing
purposes and helps businesses to better understand buying habits and
consumer needs by analysing social media posts.</p>
<p>Improvements in communications technology have also reduced business
costs through the use of cheap and effective video conferencing calls
instead of face-to-face meetings by cutting the costs of finding
suitable venues as well as suitable timeframes to meet in person.</p>
<h3 id="finance">Finance</h3>
<p>Financial technology has enabled consumers to spend, borrow, invest
and save money through low-cost and easy-to-use mobile and web
applications. There is no need to perform such transactions in person.
Individuals have better education on how to make smart financial
decisions using freely available information on the Internet.</p>
<p>Threats to privacy and security of data as well as the ease of
obtaining false information on the Internet has made some people more
vulnerable to financial scams and other get-rich-quick schemes.</p>
<p>Financial technology is currently an area of growth in the financial
industry. Numerous companies have been started to make financial
services more efficient for both individuals and businesses. These
companies typically use technology and software to reduce the time, cost
and effort needed for payments, investments, fundraising, trading,
and/or data analysis for both businesses and individuals.</p>
<p>With the evolution of technology, the time needed to perform a
financial trade has decreased from seconds down to mere microseconds.
This has led to the rise of algorithmic trading, which is the study and
refinement of algorithms to make trading decisions at speeds not
possible by a human being.</p>
<p>Many banks also use AI to analyse transaction data and automatically
identify unusual spending patterns or money transfers. This helps them
to automatically detect and prevent instances of financial fraud without
the need for manual intervention.</p>
<h3 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h3>
<p>On the positive side, technology has enabled telemedicine, which is
the use of video conferencing and other technologies, for doctors to
provide medical consultations and diagnoses over the Internet or
applications in mobile devices. This gives patients who are located in
remote places or have limited mobility better access to healthcare. By
analysing medical data, AI can automatically identify warning signs of
possible health problems and provide doctors with more accurate
diagnoses.</p>
<p>On the negative side, some patients find the use of robots and other
technology in healthcare impersonal and mistrust the ability of machines
to provide proper healthcare. Other patients may misuse information from
the internet and make potentially dangerous decisions based on incorrect
diagnoses. Patients may also be uncomfortable with the collection of
medical data necessary to improve the performance of healthcare-related
AI.</p>
<p>Technology has created new areas of growth in the healthcare
industry, such as the provision of telemedicine solutions to existing
healthcare businesses. In particular, many of these solutions provide a
way for patients to securely transfer potentially sensitive medical
information over the internet.</p>
<p>There is also an increased focus in automating healthcare processes
through the use of robots to dispense medicine and other more menial
tasks. This may in turn cause such jobs to disappear from the job
market.</p>
<p>The rise of 3D-printing technology has also opened up new
opportunities in the building and customisation of prosthetic limbs,
hearing aids and dental fixtures.</p>
<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>
<p>On the positive side, transport has become less stressful and more
predictable for travellers due to the availability of detailed maps as
well as real-time information on bus frequencies, traffic congestion
levels and street-level photographs of neighbourhoods around the world.
All this information is also available at low cost through mobile
devices. Location data from such mobile devices may also be collected by
AI to improve the accuracy and relevance of any map or traffic data that
is displayed.</p>
<p>On the negative side, some people are uncomfortable with how pictures
and information about themselves or their home may be used by mapping
companies without their permission in order to build more accurate maps
for travellers. This is especially true with regards to the collection
of location data from mobile devices as this data can reveal personal
details such as home and work addresses that users may wish to keep
private.</p>
<p>The rise of self-driving vehicles with the use of AI to recognise and
adapt to road conditions is likely to open new areas of growth in the
travel industry. Singapore is one of the first countries where
self-driving cars are being tested, and if successful, the technology
will likely revolutionise the motor industry.</p>
<p>There are also multiple new companies that offer on demand rides via
mobile applications. These developments have led to sweeping changes in
the taxi service industry as well as employment opportunities for taxi
drivers.</p>
<p>Mapping technology is also another area of growth with an increased
focus on making 3D maps and geospatial data more accessible and useful
to travellers.</p>
<h3 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h3>
<p>On the positive side, technology has enabled more exciting and
engaging forms of entertainment. Many computer games have active online
communities and mobile games have even managed to bring participants
together in the real world through in-game incentives to meet or team
up. AI has also made it possible to provide more accurate
recommendations for consumers based on collected data of their previous
choices of entertainment.</p>
<p>On the negative side, some people may be addicted to computer games
or social networking sites. There is an increasing concern that such
technology is causing people to become deficient in real-life social
skills or abandon their responsibilities. AI has also made it possible
for anyone to create doctored images and videos that appear remarkably
convincing to the average viewer. While such images and videos have been
used mostly for entertainment, they can also be used to cause public
alarm or spread damaging falsehoods.</p>
<p>Games, animation and media are areas of strong growth in the
entertainment industry with new opportunities being opened up by the
rise of high-quality virtual reality, augmented reality and motion-
tracking technology.</p>
<p>Many businesses are also using monitoring technology and strategies
from game design to provide rewards and incentives for work- related
achievements.</p>

<h2 id="data-corruption-1">Data Corruption</h2>
<p><strong>Data corruption</strong> occurs when computer data is made
unstable by errors or alterations. This can happen during the reading,
writing or transmission of data.</p>
<p>If the corrupted data cannot be recovered / replaced, this results in
<strong>data loss</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="effects-of-corruption-and-data-loss-1">Effects of Corruption and
Data Loss</h3>
<p>The effects vary depending on the amount of corrupted data and type
of data that is represented.</p>
<p>If the corrupted data is not needed to read other data, only that
data itself is lost. This is more likely if the amount of corrupted data
is small.</p>
<p>However, if the corrupted data is related to other data in the
computer, then both itself and its related data may be lost, as it may
contain information required to read/interpret the related data. This is
more likely if the amount of corrupted data is large.</p>
<h3 id="causes-and-ways-to-prevent-data-corruption-and-loss-1">Causes
and Ways to Prevent Data Corruption and Loss</h3>
<p>In all cases, making regular <strong>backups</strong> (copies of data
made in case the original data is damaged or lost) of data will help to
prevent the loss of data.</p>
<p>Causes of data corruption and loss include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Human Error</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Storage devices may be damaged during transport.</li>
<li>Multiple users working on the same file may accidentally overwrite
each other.</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>
<ul>
<li>Make regular backups of data</li>
<li>Use adequate protection when transporting storage devices.</li>
<li>Set up rules when collaborating with multiple users to prevent them
from writing to the same file at the same time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Power Failure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the power supply to a computer fails, data in the process of
being written to a storage device may become corrupted and data stored
in volatile memory and not yet written to a storage device will become
lost.</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>
<ul>
<li>Regular backups</li>
<li>Set up a backup power supply, or <strong>uninterruptible power
supply (UPS)</strong> so storage devices can complete any write
operations in case of a power failure.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Hardware Failure/Damage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All magnetic, optical and solid-state storage devices can fail,
either due to overuse, manufacturing defects, or age.</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>
<ul>
<li>Regular backups</li>
<li>Check storage device regularly and replace them immediately when
signs of failure are detected.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Malware/viruses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some malware may purposely damage and corrupt data as a way of
attacking the computer</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>
<ul>
<li>Regular backups</li>
<li>Avoid opening emails/attachments or files from unknown sources.</li>
<li>Install and configure a firewall to prevent malware from spreading
through the network.</li>
<li>Install anti-virus and anti-spyware software and perform regular
scans and updates</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>An <strong>uninterruptible power supply</strong> is a device that
provides enough emergency power for a computer to properly shut down in
the event of a power failure.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-1">Authentication</h2>
<p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It
requires the user to prove their identity by providing evidence from one
or more of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something the user knows (password)</li>
<li>Something the user owns (mobile phone)</li>
<li>Something physically unique about the user (thumbprint)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category of evidence used for authentication is called an
<strong>authentication factor</strong></p>
<h3 id="passwords-1">Passwords</h3>
<p>Passwords are the most common form of authentication. Some passwords
are entered together with a username that identifies who the user claims
to be.</p>
<p>They can be a poor form of authentication if they are chosen poorly
or not well-kept as a secret. Avoid using birthdates, surnames and other
things that can be easily guessed.</p>
<p>Use hard to guess passwords that are a mixture of lowercase,
uppercase letters, numbers and symbols.</p>
<p>Avoid re-using passwords or leaving them unchanged for a long time as
it makes it easier for an intruder to guess the password. Use unique
passwords for each computer and account, and update them at least once
every 90 days.</p>
<h3 id="unauthorised-access-1">Unauthorised Access</h3>
<p>Some authentication systems require evidence from more than 1
authentication factor. Banks typically issue a device called a security
token to users who wish to access their accounts online.</p>
<p>A <strong>security token</strong> is a device used specifically for
authentication purposes, such as mobile phones and one-time passwords
(OTPs).</p>
<p>The type of authentication that uses evidence from both something a
user knows and owns is called <strong>2-factor
authentication</strong>.</p>
<p>2FA is stronger than a singular password as it is more difficult for
an intruder to both guess a password and steal the user’s security
token. Hence, it is important to keep the security token in a secure
location at all times and to report a missing security token as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>If an OTP is sent wirelessly to a user’s mobile phone, it may be
intercepted and used by an intruder during the transmission process. If
the secret algorithm used to generate OTPs is poorly chosen or
accidentally revealed, an intruder may find out how to generate OTPs
without needing the security token at all.</p>
<p>There is not much a user can do about this type of intrusion
attempt.</p>
<h3 id="biometrics-1">Biometrics</h3>
<p><strong>Biometrics</strong> is a type of authentication that is based
on the measurement of human physical characteristics.</p>
<p>For example, biometrics is used to identify a user by fingerprint or
voice. Other characteristics used include the face, iris, retina, and
DNA.</p>
<p>The use of biometric identification is more secure as the physical
characteristics measured are typically unique to the individual and
cannot be easily replicated. Thus, it helps prevent attempts to
establish fraudulent identities and <strong>identity theft</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Identity theft</strong> is the impersonation of another
person to steal personal details such as name and identity number for
fraudulent purposes.</p>
<h2 id="authorisation-1">Authorisation</h2>
<p>Once the user is authenticated, the ability of a computer to control
the access of data and resources by that user is called <strong>access
control/authorisation</strong>.</p>
<p>Computers provide access control through a variety of means.</p>
<h3 id="file-permissions-1">File Permissions</h3>
<p>Most operating systems have settings to control the ability of users
to view or make changes to specific files or folders. These settings are
called <strong>permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>An application of file permissions is when a teacher may set a
presentation file to be read-only for students, so they do not
accidentally (or intentionally) change its contents.</p>
<p>Typically, users can only change the permissions for any file or
folder they own. However, most OS's allow for a special user called the
<strong>administrator</strong>, who can override the permissions for
almost any file or folder.</p>
<p>A normal user may also be given special <strong>administrator
rights</strong> that allow them to override the permissions for certain
files or folders, just like an administrator.</p>
<p>Managing permissions and administrative rights can be a complex task,
and it is possible to accidentally grant access to a file or
administrative rights to an unauthorised user. Such a user can then make
use of such mistakes to gain unauthorised access to data and
resources.</p>
<p>Authentication for the administrator must be especially strong, as an
intruder that successfully claims to be an administrator can bypass file
permissions entirely.</p>
<p>File permissions do not prevent an intruder with physical access to a
storage device from accessing files or folders directly without going
through the operating system. To prevent such access, it is necessary to
use encryption.</p>
<p>File permissions can be used as access control for both computers
connected to a network and computers that are not connected to a
network, but are shared by multiple users.</p>
<h3 id="firewalls-1">Firewalls</h3>
<p>Computers connected to a network are naturally more susceptible to
intrusion as unauthorised access can occur without the physical presence
of an intruder.</p>
<p>Hence, computers connected to a network usually require another layer
of access control called a <strong>firewall</strong></p>
<p>A firewall is a device/network that prevents unauthorised access to
or from a private network. It works by monitoring each piece of data
transmitted through a network. It then either blocks or allows data to
pass based on a set of rules configured by an administrator.</p>
<p>When properly configured, a firewall can protect computers within a
network from unauthorised access. They can be configured to block the
transmission of data (aka <strong>traffic</strong>) between unauthorised
senders and receivers, especially requests for data from anonymous users
on the internet. This prevents intruders from gaining access to the
computers within a network.</p>
<p>Since firewalls can also block traffic based on the type of
application that is transmitting the data, it can also stop certain
harmful programs from sending copies of themselves to other computers
through the network.</p>
<p>Configuring a firewall correctly can be complex and a misconfigured
firewall may have security vulnerabilities that allows intruders to gain
unauthorised access.</p>
<p>A properly configured firewall allows for a private network (aka
<strong>intranet</strong>) to be set up such that all external traffic
is blocked and only authenticated and authorised users are able to
access it. Since the users on a private network are generally trusted
and expected to keep information on the network confidential, there are
usually fewer concerns about unauthorised access when sharing data on a
private network.</p>
<p>Conversely, a private network such as the Internet allows anyone to
connect to it and share data. Since public networks have little-to-no
restrictions, users need to be wary of possible security and privacy
risks when accessing it.</p>
<h2 id="encryption-1">Encryption</h2>
<p><strong>Encryption</strong> is the process of encoding data so that a
secret key is required to read the data. Like passwords, the secret key
is usually provided as a sequence of bytes.</p>
<p>Before the encrypted data is decoded using the secret key, it appears
as random and meaningless data.</p>
<p>Encryption is often used to protect data from unauthorised access by
allowing only authorised users to have the secret key. It can be used in
combination with file permissions so an unauthorised user who bypasses
file permissions would still be unable to use the accessed data without
knowing the secret key.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-of-privacy-policies-1">Understanding of Privacy
Policies</h2>
<p>Unauthorised access can occur indirectly due to the actions of
3rd-party users or services.</p>
<p>For example, a user alters file permissions to let a classmate access
some private files. That classmate in turn shares those files with
others without the original user's knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - The ability to keep specific data or
resources from being known by others.
<ul>
<li>In many countries, organisations are required by law to publicise or
make available a privacy policy about the rules and practices they
follow regarding the collection, protection and use of personal or
private data provided by users.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Organisations in Singapore are required by
the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) to make their privacy policies
available upon request.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>An increasing number of users share personal information such as
photos and location data using online services, many of them are
unfamiliar with the relevant privacy policies or how such sharing habits
may indirectly result in unauthorised access. A poor understanding of
the privacy policies of these services can often result in unauthorised
access.</p>
<h3 id="social-networking-sites-1">Social Networking Sites</h3>
<p>Social networking sites such as Twitter, Instagram and TikTok allow
users to share photographs and information quickly with their families
or friends. They can also be used to promote businesses or raise
awareness of campaigns or causes.</p>
<p>However, these sites can pose many privacy concerns because most
users do not read or consider the repercussions of the privacy policies
used by these sites regarding personal information such as status
updates, notes, photographs and location data.</p>
<p>The privacy policies for many social networking sites do not
guarantee that personal data collected will never be exposed to
unauthorised users and may even require that your personal data be
shared with advertisers in order to use their sites. Hence, personal
data can potentially be harvested for spam and other threats to privacy
that users did not authorise directly.</p>
<p>Remember: Once data is digitised and uploaded to a public network
such as the Internet, it can potentially remain there forever, since it
can be easily copied and republished in ways no longer under the control
of the original uploader.</p>
<p>Oh, and also some privacy policies for some social networking sites
don’t guarantee that their personal data will be deleted from the site
completely or immediately even after their account is closed, deleted,
or has all personal data removed from it.</p>
<p>Personal data is sensitive and should not be shared publicly. Some
companies may reject candidates after reviewing the information and
photographs posted on their social networking accounts, even if this was
posted while they were still at school.</p>
<h2 id="summary-1">Summary</h2>
<h3 id="preventing-unauthorised-access-1">Preventing Unauthorised
Access</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read and fully understand the privacy policy of the social
networking site.</li>
<li>Set sharing settings to "private" so only people you know in real
life can read your posts.</li>
<li>Think twice before posting personal photographs or information that
you may feel uncomfortable sharing.</li>
<li>Accept friend requests wisely. Make sure you know everyone in your
friends list.</li>

Measures Against Privacy and Security Threats</h3>
<h4 id="installing-anti-virus-and-anti-spyware-programs-1">Installing
anti-virus and anti-spyware programs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-Spyware</strong> - Software to detect, remove and stop
spyware and other malware from running.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-virus</strong> - Software to detect, remove and stop
viruses and other malware from running.</li>
</ul>
<p>Counters viruses, worms, spyware and Trojan horses, since they need
to run on a user's computer in order to perform their respective
attacks.</p>
<p>These programs can be used to scan a user's storage and email to
detect and remove malware. If a program has been infected by a virus, it
may also try to restore the original program.</p>
<p>Although powerful, most rely on a list of
<strong>signatures</strong>, unique evidence used to detect a known
version of some malicious software. This list has to be updated
regularly to ensure protection provided continues to be effective
against new malware. Most programs update the list automatically through
the Internet.</p>
<p>Some especially devious Trojan horses appear to be anti-virus and
anti-spyware programs. Only trust programs provided by reputable
companies, or as part of the computer's <strong>operating
system</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="operating-system-1">Operating System</h3>
<p>An <strong>operating system</strong> is software designed to support
a computer's basic functions, such as Windows and MacOS.</p>
<h3 id="update-software-regularly-1">Update Software Regularly</h3>
<p>Most malware require human interaction to activate, but worms can run
automatically by exploiting bugs in otherwise legitimate programs
already running on a computer.</p>
<p>For example, a flawed web browser may have a bug that allows websites
to run malicious programs without the user's knowledge.</p>
<p>To prevent this, update software regularly so bugs that were
discovered since the last update can be fixed. This is especially
important for software used to interact with public networks like the
Internet, as data from public networks is more likely to be malicious
and designed to take advantage of known bugs.</p>
<h3 id="identity-phishing-1">Identity Phishing</h3>
<p>Phishing emails should be ignored and deleted. There are several
telltale signs to identify phishing emails.</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims to be from a company/bank asking for confidential
information. Most companies and banks never ask for such information via
email. If in doubt, call the company or bank to verify.</li>
<li>Generic greeting such as "Dear User", it is a sign that the email
was sent automatically and not by a person.</li>
<li>Inaccurate logos and grammatical or spelling errors.</li>
<li>Sender's email address or contact does not match the supposed source
of email.</li>
<li>Email has hyperlinks with destinations that do not match what the
hyperlink text says or is otherwise unexpected. Place mouse cursor over
the hyperlink and its destination should appear as a popup or on the
status bar.</li>
<li>Excessively urgent or threatening tone, a scare tactic to make
victims act before they can think through their actions properly.</li>
<li>Email promises offers that are too good to be true, tempting victims
into revealing personal information.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identity-pharming-1">Identity Pharming</h3>
<p>Pharming is like phishing V2. The attacker attempts to intercept
requests sent from a computer to a legitimate website and redirects the
user to a fake website to steal personal data.</p>
<p>For example, a victim of pharming may log into their bank account,
and are presented with a website that looks like the bank, but isn't.
The attacker can now retrieve your account details to access your bank
account on the actual website, stealing your money.</p>
<p>For pharming to be successful, the attacker must either have malware
running on the victim's computer or has taken control of a network
device such as a router or server. This can occur as the software that
runs on such devices is also susceptible to bugs.</p>
<p>It is harder to detect as everything seems to be normal while the
attack takes place. Measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure encryption is used when submitting sensitive information via
the internet. Check if there's a padlock icon at the address bar.</li>
<li>Regularly check bank, debit/credit card and other statements to
ensure all transactions are legitimate.</li>
<li>Regularly update web browsers and the software running on the
network hardware so that all known bugs are fixed.</li>
<li>Enable 2FA for all bank transactions. This means even if the
attacker is able to access the bank account, no unauthorised
transactions can occur as the attacker would not be able to provide the
required OTP.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="manage-spam-1">Manage Spam</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid giving your email to unfamiliar contacts or untrusted
websites. If you really need to provide one, use a temporary email
generator like 10minutemail. Or, set up a secondary email address
dedicated to unimportant emails.</li>
<li>Read and understand the privacy policy of any website, trusted or
untrusted, that requests an email address before providing it. Some
websites share email addresses with advertisers who spam.</li>
<li>Look for options to disable email update or participation in mailing
lists when signing up or changing online account settings.</li>
<li>Most email services have a filter feature that allow users to block
specific senders or to only allow emails from specific senders through.
<ul>
<li>Some filtering systems have advanced spam detection algorithms that
can be trained by having the user identify examples of spam the filter
is not yet able to detect. This lets the filter become more effective in
detecting spam over time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="manage-cookies-1">Manage Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the web browser when a
user visits a website. Each time a user visits a website that uses
cookies, the browser checks whether it has a relevant cookie and if so,
it sends the information contained in that cookie back to the

<h2 id="intellectual-property-1">Intellectual Property</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property</strong> - Creations of the mind that
have value but can exist purely as data with no physical form.</li>
<li><strong>Copyright</strong> - The legal right of owners to control
the use and distribution of their intellectual property.</li>
<li><strong>License</strong> - Official description of activities that
are authorised or forbidden by the owner of intellectual property.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-software-licenses-1">Types of Software Licenses</h3>
<p>There are several types of software licenses in order to avoid
infringing copyright laws.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Public Domain Software</strong> - Software where the
legal protections that are typically granted to intellectual property
have either expired, surrendered or are simply inapplicable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not protected by copyright, anybody can legally copy, modify and
distribute public domain software. It may not always come with source
code, though most do.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)</strong> - Software
where users are given freedom to change, copy, study and share the
software and its source code.</p>
<ul>
<li>The term "free" refers to free to use, not free of charge.</li>
<li>Similar to public domain software, but is still protected under
copyright and the copyright owners may use this protection to require
that the software must always be distributed with source code,
attribution to the original authors must be provided or any
modifications must use a similar license if distributed.</li>
<li>Other types of copyrighted works such as books, photographs and
music must be licensed in a similar manner using Creative Commons (CC)
licenses. Note that CC licenses grant users freedom to copy, modify and
distribute copyrighted works, CC licenses are not designed for software
and should not be used for this purpose. It can, however, be used to
license content that is delivered using software. Higher education
course materials such as videos and notes created by universities and
distributed for free on the Internet, aka <strong>open
courseware</strong> often use CC licenses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Courseware</strong> - Higher-education course
materials such as videos and notes created by universities and
distributed for free on the Internet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proprietary Software</strong> - Commercial software for
which most of the legal protections under copyright are retained.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike FOSS, it is usually not legal to copy, modify or distribute
proprietary software. The terms and conditions for which the proprietary
software may or may not be used under copyright protection law are
usually communicated by users through an End User License Agreement
(EULA) contract that the user must accept to use the software.</li>
<li>The source code for proprietary software is usually kept
secret.</li>
<li>Although it seems super restrictive compared to FOSS, it is
important to remember that software is a form of intellectual property
and it is the right of the owner to be compensated for the use of the
property. An example of proprietary software is Windows OS, where
unauthorised copying is illegal and the majority of source code is kept
secret.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Freeware</strong> - Proprietary software that is
available for use at no cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some freeware are "lite" versions of proprietary software, allowing
users to try a limited version of the software while promoting the full
version</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Shareware</strong> - Demonstration software that is
distributed for free but a specific evaluation period only.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the evaluation period, the program expires and the user can no
longer access the program unless the user pays a registration fee.</li>
<li>The source code for freeware and shareware is usually kept secret
and modifying the software is usually kept illegal. However, it may be
legal to copy and distribute freeware and shareware. Adobe Reader and
Skype are examples of freeware, and Camtasia Studio and WinRAR are
examples of shareware.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software-piracy-1">Software Piracy</h3>
<p><strong>Software piracy</strong> is the crime of copying,
distributing or using proprietary software illegally. Despite being
illegal, it is prevalent and can take place in many forms.</p>
<p>Installing multiple copies of proprietary software without purchasing
additional licenses or sharing proprietary software with unlicensed
users is considered software piracy and can result in similar legal
repercussions.</p>
<p>Software piracy causes significant loss of revenue for the owners of
intellectual property, which leads to higher prices for legitimate
buyers.</p>
<p><strong>Cracks</strong> are programs that modify proprietary software
so that the software cannot detect that it is being used illegally.
Software piracy is an example of <strong>copyright
infringement</strong>, which is the use or distribution of copyrighted
work without the permission of the copyright owner. While software
piracy is specific to software, copyright infringement can occur for any
copyrighted materials, such as pictures on the Internet, which is
equivalent to theft.</p>
<h3 id="plagiarism-1">Plagiarism</h3>
<p><strong>Plagiarism</strong> is the act of passing off someone else's
original work as your own, aka the act of claiming to be the author of a
piece of work without providing proper credit or attribution to the
actual author.</p>
<p>Unlike copyright infringement, plagiarism may not always be illegal,
but it is nevertheless an act of dishonesty and is usually a punishable
offense in academia.</p>
<p>Plagiarism can still occur when the original owner of a piece of work
consents to letting someone use it as their own.</p>
<p>To avoid plagiarism, you can use <strong>citations</strong> to give
proper credit to the original authors of any reproduced materials in
published books, websites and articles.</p>
<h2 id="impact-of-technology-on-daily-life-1">Impact of Technology on
Daily Life</h2>
<h3 id="communication-1">Communication</h3>
<p>The Internet has enabled diverse cultures to interact and share ideas
with each other. Social networking sites have enabled users to remain
connected with friends, family and colleagues over long distances.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence has made it possible for anyone to
automatically transcribe and translate speech into different languages
with high speed and accuracy.</p>
<p>Some people on the Internet use the Internet to reinforce their
existing opinions, or to spread the rumors, misinformation, or
propaganda. This is worsened by the use of AI by some news and social
and media sites to promote content the reader is likely to be interested
in. Most sites promote content based on engagement and not accuracy.</p>
<p>Smart phones have led to an increased focus on mobile devices and
mobile applications in the computing industry.</p>
<p>Social media has led to increased use of social media for marketing
purposes and helps businesses to better understand buying habits and
consumer needs by analysing social media posts.</p>
<p>Improvements in communications technology have also reduced business
costs through the use of cheap and effective video conferencing calls
instead of face-to-face meetings by cutting the costs of finding
suitable venues as well as suitable timeframes to meet in person.</p>
<h3 id="finance-1">Finance</h3>
<p>Financial technology has enabled consumers to spend, borrow, invest
and save money through low-cost and easy-to-use mobile and web
applications. There is no need to perform such transactions in person.
Individuals have better education on how to make smart financial
decisions using freely available information on the Internet.</p>
<p>Threats to privacy and security of data as well as the ease of
obtaining false information on the Internet has made some people more
vulnerable to financial scams and other get-rich-quick schemes.</p>
<p>Financial technology is currently an area of growth in the financial
industry. Numerous companies have been started to make financial
services more efficient for both individuals and businesses. These
companies typically use technology and software to reduce the time, cost
and effort needed for payments, investments, fundraising, trading,
and/or data analysis for both businesses and individuals.</p>
<p>With the evolution of technology, the time needed to perform a
financial trade has decreased from seconds down to mere microseconds.
This has led to the rise of algorithmic trading, which is the study and
refinement of algorithms to make trading decisions at speeds not
possible by a human being.</p>
<p>Many banks also use AI to analyse transaction data and automatically
identify unusual spending patterns or money transfers. This helps them
to automatically detect and prevent instances of financial fraud without
the need for manual intervention.</p>
<h3 id="healthcare-1">Healthcare</h3>
<p>On the positive side, technology has enabled telemedicine, which is
the use of video conferencing and other technologies, for doctors to
provide medical consultations and diagnoses over the Internet or
applications in mobile devices. This gives patients who are located in
remote places or have limited mobility better access to healthcare. By
analysing medical data, AI can automatically identify warning signs of
possible health problems and provide doctors with more accurate
diagnoses.</p>
<p>On the negative side, some patients find the use of robots and other
technology in healthcare impersonal and mistrust the ability of machines
to provide proper healthcare. Other patients may misuse information from
the internet and make potentially dangerous decisions based on incorrect
diagnoses. Patients may also be uncomfortable with the collection of
medical data necessary to improve the performance of healthcare-related
AI.</p>
<p>Technology has created new areas of growth in the healthcare
industry, such as the provision of telemedicine solutions to existing
healthcare businesses. In particular, many of these solutions provide a
way for patients to securely transfer potentially sensitive medical
information over the internet.</p>
<p>There is also an increased focus in automating healthcare processes
through the use of robots to dispense medicine and other more menial
tasks. This may in turn cause such jobs to disappear from the job
market.</p>
<p>The rise of 3D-printing technology has also opened up new
opportunities in the building and customisation of prosthetic limbs,
hearing aids and dental fixtures.</p>
<h3 id="transportation-1">Transportation</h3>
<p>On the positive side, transport has become less stressful and more
predictable for travellers due to the availability of detailed maps as
well as real-time information on bus frequencies, traffic congestion
levels and street-level photographs of neighbourhoods around the world.
All this information is also available at low cost through mobile
devices. Location data from such mobile devices may also be collected by
AI to improve the accuracy and relevance of any map or traffic data that
is displayed.</p>
<p>On the negative side, some people are uncomfortable with how pictures
and information about themselves or their home may be used by mapping
companies without their permission in order to build more accurate maps
for travellers. This is especially true with regards to the collection
of location data from mobile devices as this data can reveal personal
details such as home and work addresses that users may wish to keep
private.</p>
<p>The rise of self-driving vehicles with the use of AI to recognise and
adapt to road conditions is likely to open new areas of growth in the
travel industry. Singapore is one of the first countries where
self-driving cars are being tested, and if successful, the technology
will likely revolutionise the motor industry.</p>
<p>There are also multiple new companies that offer on demand rides via
mobile applications. These developments have led to sweeping changes in
the taxi service industry as well as employment opportunities for taxi
drivers.</p>
<p>Mapping technology is also another area of growth with an increased
focus on making 3D maps and geospatial data more accessible and useful
to travellers.</p>
<h3 id="entertainment-1">Entertainment</h3>
<p>On the positive side, technology has enabled more exciting and
engaging forms of entertainment. Many computer games have active online
communities and mobile games have even managed to bring participants
together in the real world through in-game incentives to meet or team
up. AI has also made it possible to provide more accurate
recommendations for consumers based on collected data of their previous
choices of entertainment.</p>
<p>On the negative side, some people may be addicted to computer games
or social networking sites. There is an increasing concern that such
technology is causing people to become deficient in real-life social
skills or abandon their responsibilities. AI has also made it possible
for anyone to create doctored images and videos that appear remarkably
convincing to the average viewer. While such images and videos have been
used mostly for entertainment, they can also be used to cause public
alarm or spread damaging falsehoods.</p>
<p>Games, animation and media are areas of strong growth in the
entertainment industry with new opportunities being opened up by the
rise of high-quality virtual reality, augmented reality and motion-
tracking technology.</p>
<p>Many businesses are also using monitoring technology and strategies
from game design to provide rewards and incentives for work- related
achievements.</p>
