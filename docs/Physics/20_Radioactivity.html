<h2 id="composition-of-an-atom">Composition of an Atom</h2>
<ul>
<li>An atom is very tiny and typically has a size of <strong><span
class="math inline">\(1 \times 10^{-10} \pu{m}\)</span></strong>.</li>
<li>It is made up of <strong>subatomic particles</strong> such as
protons, neutrons and electrons.</li>
<li>An atom consists of a positively charged nucleus and negatively
charged electrons moving around the nucleus.</li>
<li>The nucleus of an atom consists of two types of particles - protons
and neutrons.</li>
<li>Strong attractive electrostatic forces between the positively
charged nucleus and negatively charged electrons hold the electrons to
the atom.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proton-atomic-number-z">Proton (atomic) Number Z.</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>proton number <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span></strong> is the number of protons in an
atom.</li>
<li>The proton number is also known as the <strong>atomic
number</strong>.</li>
<li>In a neutral atom, the number of protons is the same as the number
of electrons.</li>
<li>Each element has a unique proton number.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nucleon-mass-number-a">Nucleon (Mass) Number A</h3>
<ul>
<li>Proton and neutrons are called <strong>nucleons</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>nucleon number</strong> is the total number of neutrons
and protons in the nucleus of an atom.</li>
<li>The symbol <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is used to
represent the nucleon number of an element.</li>
<li>The nucleon number is also known as the <strong>mass
number.</strong></li>
<li>The mass of an atom depends on the mass of nucleons in the nucleus
of the atom as the mass of an electron is very small and thus
negligible.</li>
<li>To find the number of neutrons in an atom,</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[Number \space of \space neutrons = A -
Z\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Note that in nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, the various
species of atoms whose nuclei contain a particular number of protons and
neutrons are called <strong>nuclides.</strong></li>
<li>The nucleus of an atom can be represented by the <strong>nuclide
notation:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\ce{^{A}_{Z}X}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="isotopes">Isotopes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isotopes</strong> are atoms of the same element that have
the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.</li>
<li>Isotopes of the same elements have <em>identical</em> chemical
properties.</li>
<li>Example: carbon isotopes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nuclear-decay">Nuclear Decay</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nuclear decay</strong> is also known as radioactive decay or
radioactivity.</li>
<li>Nuclear decay is a random process by which an unstable atomic
nucleus loses its energy by emission of electromagnetic radiation or
particle(s).</li>
<li>The radiation emitted by a radioactive nucleus is
<em>spontaneous</em> and <em>random</em> in direction.</li>
<li>Spontaneous decay means that the decay is not affected by
environmental changes (e.g. temperature and pressure.)</li>
<li>Random decay means that the decay cannot be predicted which
particular nucleus will decay next.</li>
<li>A material containing unstable nuclei is considered
radioactive.</li>
<li>The instability of the atomic nuclei is because the nuclear forces
within the nuclei are not enough to bind the nucleons together.</li>
<li>Since the direction of the emissions and the time between emissions
cannot be predicted, hence it is:
<ul>
<li>not possible to make the radioactive nucleus emit radiation by
heating, cooling, chemical means or any other method;</li>
<li>not possible to predict when a radioactive nucleus will emit
radiation; and</li>
<li>not possible to know the direction in which the emitted radiation
will leave a nucleus.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-nuclear-emission">Types of Nuclear Emission</h3>
<p>There are three types of nuclear emission: <strong>alpha (<span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) particles, beta (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>) particles and gamma (<span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>) rays.</strong> Different nuclear
emissions have different compositions, ionising effects and penetrating
abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Ionisation</strong> refers to the ability to eject electrons
from atoms to form positively charged cations. Since the atoms lose
electrons, the number of protons is greater than the number of
electrons. Thus, ions carry a charge. The nuclei of the same isotope
will emit the same type of nuclear radiation. During alpha decay or beta
decay, the nucleus changes to that of a different element.</p>
<h4 id="alpha-decay">Alpha Decay</h4>
<ul>
<li>When a radioactive nucleus undergoes alpha decay:
<ul>
<li>it emits an alpha particle (identical to helium nucleus <span
class="math inline">\(\ce{^4_2He}\)</span>)</li>
<li>the nucleon number A decreases by 4</li>
<li>the proton number Z decreases by 2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <strong>nuclide equation</strong> involving nuclide notation can
be used to represent the changes in the composition of the nucleus. The
arrow in the equation means "reacts to form".</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Radium-226 (Ra) nucleus emits an alpha particle and decays
to radon-222 (Rn).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\ce{^{226}_{88}Ra -&gt; ^{222}_{86}Rn +
^4_2He}\]</span></p>
<p>Note that in a nuclear reaction, the <strong>mass and charge are
conserved.</strong> Hence, before and after the reaction,</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of neutrons and protons remain constant, and</li>
<li>The total relative charge should also be the same (i.e. sum of
proton number before and after decay should be the same.)</li>
</ul>

<li>When a radioactive nucleus undergoes ß-decay:

<li>it emits</li>
