Induction</h3>
<h4 id="faradays-law-of-electromagnetic-induction">Faraday's law of
electromagnetic induction</h4>
<p>The magnitude of the electromotive force (e.m.f) induced in a closed
circuit is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic
flux linkage through the area bounded by the circuit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, the magnitude of the electromotive force (e.m.f) induced in a
conductor is directly proportional to the rate at which magnetic field
lines and the conductor cut each other.</li>
<li>If the conductor is part of a closed circuit, the induced e.m.f
produces an induced current through the conductor.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="lenzs-law">Lenz's Law</h4>
<p>The direction of the induced electromotive force (and hence the
direction of the induced current in a closed circuit) is such that its
magnetic effect opposes the motion or change producing it.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the conductor is part of a closed circuit, the induced current
produces induced magnetic poles that oppose the cause of the induced
emf.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="electromagnetic-induction-when-magnetic-field-strength-changes">Electromagnetic
induction when magnetic field strength changes</h3>
<p>Faraday's experiments demonstrate electromagnetic induction by moving
a pole of a magnet moves nearer or further away from a solenoid, such
that magnetic field lines cut through the solenoid.</p>
<h3 id="case-1-s-moves-towards-solenoid">Case 1: S moves towards
solenoid</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>The South pole of the magnet moves towards the solenoid</li>
<li>(By Faraday's law of induction,) the changing magnetic flux linkage
through the solenoid (or the magnetic field lines cutting the solenoid)
induces an e.m.f in the solenoid.</li>
<li>Since the circuit is closed, the induced e.m.f produces an induced
current.</li>
<li>By Lenz's law, the magnet is repelled by the south pole induced on
the right of the solenoid produced by the clockwise induced current when
viewed from the right (using the right hand grip rule) that flows from B
to A.</li>
