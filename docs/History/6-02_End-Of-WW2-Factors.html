of the United States - Economic and Military Strengths of the United
States (Europe and the Asia-Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States’ vast resources
were mobilised within a short time. Its people, factories, shipyards,
farms and even Hollywood and the movie industry joined in the war
effort. For example, by 1944, the United States was producing almost
half of the weapons being made globally – more than twice the production
of Germany and Japan combined. In total, between 1941 and 1945, US
factories produced 250,000 aircraft, 90,000 tanks, 350 naval destroyers,
200 submarines and 5,600 merchant ships.</p>
<h4 id="link">Link</h4>
<p>This massive production derived from American economic strength
translated into military strength as it supplied it and the other Allied
powers with a vast amount of military equipment and other resources
essential for the war effort. Resources that the Axis powers simply
could not match, thus giving the Allies a overwhelming advantage that
allowed them to win the war</p>
<h3
id="importance-of-the-united-states---battle-of-the-atlantic-europe">Importance
of the United States - Battle of the Atlantic (Europe)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-1">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>Control of the Atlantic was vital to the Allied war effort as it was
only control of the shipping routes across the Atlantic that vital
American supplies could shipped to to Britain and to the USSR. This
control was only achieved through a bitter struggle and at a high cost
by the Allies. German submarines (U-boats) were very effective early in
the Battle of the Atlantic. In 1940, the Germans sank over 1,000 ships,
a quarter of Britain’s merchant fleet. In 1941, 1,300 Allied ships were
lost, and in 1942, 1,661 ships. As a result, in January 1943, the
British navy had only two months’ supply of oil left. The tide began to
turn through 1943. British intelligence was able to break the secret
codes used by the U-boats. This allowed the Allied convoys to steer
clear of the U-boats, hence ensuring Britain and the USSR had the
resources to fend off the Axis powers. New weapons and tactics were also
developed to counter the U-boats.</p>
<h4 id="link-1">Link</h4>
<p>This victory allowed the much needed American supplies to reach
Britain and to the USSR, allowing them to continue the fight against the
Axis that would ultimately conclude in an Allied victory in World War
2.</p>
<h3
id="importance-of-the-united-states---island-hopping-strategy-in-the-asia-pacific-the-asia-pacific">Importance
of the United States - Island-Hopping Strategy in the Asia-Pacific (The
Asia-Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-2">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>To avoid a potentially lengthy and costly campaign against the
Japanese forces which had dug themselves into island strongholds across
the vast empire they had built from 1937-1941, the Allies came up with
the strategy of island-hopping. It involved using air attacks and
submarines to isolate Japanese-held areas, instead of trying to capture
them. The Allies would then conquer the islands, which were poorly
defended, and use them to further cut off ships that supplied the
well-defended islands. The idea was to cut off some areas from their
supplies of food, ammunition and other essentials.</p>
<h4 id="link-2">Link</h4>
<p>This approach proved to be successful. It allowed the Allies to incur
fewer casualties and come within striking distance of Japan itself in
just a few years. It thus contributed to Allied victory in World War
2.</p>
<h3
id="importance-of-the-united-states---use-of-the-atomic-bomb-the-asia-pacific">Importance
of the United States - Use of the Atomic Bomb (The Asia-Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-3">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>Faced with the strong resistance of the Japanese forces, the United
States decided to use its newly developed atomic bombs without warning.
On 6 August 1945, the American bomber, Enola Gay, dropped a five-ton
atomic bomb, nicknamed “Little Boy”, over the Japanese city of
Hiroshima. Following this, on 9 August, the United States dropped a
second atomic bomb, nicknamed “Fat Man”, over the city of Nagasaki. In
total, the two atomic bombings killed more than 100,000 people and
injured another 100,000.</p>
<h4 id="link-3">Link</h4>
<p>The devastation brought about by the two atomic bombs was one of the
key reasons for Japan’s surrender, securing Allied victory in World War
2.</p>
<h3
id="importance-of-britain---british-resistance-to-german-invasion-europe">Importance
of Britain - British resistance to German invasion (Europe)</h3>
<h3 id="example-and-explanation-4">Example and Explanation</h3>
<p>A key factor in the defeat of the Axis powers was Britain’s ability
to resist the German invasion in 1940–1941. During the Battle of
Britain, Britain’s Royal Air Force (RAF) had excellent fighter aircraft
such as the Supermarine Spitfire, and the Hawker Hurricane British
aircraft were as good as the Germans’. Additionally, the factories were
able to keep producing more of such aircraft to replace their losses.
Moreover, the British had the new technology of radar which could be
used to detect and locate incoming enemy aircraft. Fighting over home
ground also gave the British the advantage of tapping large reserves of
spare parts for repair work and using less fuel for its war
production.</p>
<h4 id="link-4">Link</h4>
<p>Thanks to these advantages, the British were able to win the Battle
of Britain and prevent a German invasion of their country. This allowed
Britain to become a substantial military base for the Allies. A base
that made the D-Day landings of 1944 and the Allied bombing campaigns
against Germany possible. Campaigns that ultimately led to the defeat of
Germany.</p>
<h3
id="importance-of-britain---british-resistance-to-the-japanese-the-asia-pacific">Importance
of Britain - British resistance to the Japanese (The Asia Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-5">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>The British Empire was a major source of the manpower and resources
that opposed the Japanese in the Asia‑Pacific. The armies and navies of
Britain, Australia, New Zealand and around 120,000 African troops from
British colonies fought alongside US troops against the Japanese. The
British Empire forces also included the immense manpower and resources
of India. India provided over 2.5 million men and women and a staggering
80 percent of its wealth to the Allied war effort. Although Indian
troops fought in North Africa and Europe as well, the majority fought in
Asia against the Japanese.</p>
<h4 id="link-5">Link</h4>
<p>Thus the British represented a major component of the manpower and
resources opposed to the Japanese in the Asia-Pacific. They thus played
a vital part in the effort to defeat the Japanese and securing an Allied
victory in World War 2.</p>
<h3
id="importance-of-the-ussr---reorganisation-and-resistance-europe">Importance
of the USSR - Reorganisation and resistance (Europe)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-reorganisation">Example and Explanation
(Reorganisation)</h4>
<p>When the German advance was halted by the Russian winter in late
1941, Stalin and his military leaders used this time to reform the Red
Army completely. They copied many of the tactics and ideas used by the
Germans and added some of their own. For example, the Red Army created
specialist tank armies and air forces. At the same time, harsh
discipline was enforced, such as, Order 227 of July 1942 which ordered
the Soviet Army to fight and die for every bit of Russian soil.</p>
<h4 id="link-reorganisation">Link (Reorganisation)</h4>
<p>By taking such steps to reorganize the Red Army, the USSR was able to
improve its ability to fight the Germans. An ability that ultimately
allowed them to turn the tide and not only push the invaders out of
their country but to launch a counterattack that saw them invading and
occupying parts of Germany itself, securing victory in World War 2.</p>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-resistance">Example and Explanation
(Resistance)</h4>
<p>The Soviet Union suffered heavy losses in the early phases of the
German invasion. However, it nevertheless continued to fiercely resist.
The Germans had advanced again in 1942 towards the city of Stalingrad.
Here, the Soviets held them in a fierce battle and, despite suffering
heavy casualties, were eventually able to encircle the Germans, forcing
them to surrender.</p>
<h4 id="link-resistance">Link (Resistance)</h4>
<p>This victory raised the morale of the Soviets as they began to drive
the Germans back. A counterattack that led to them not only pushing the
invaders out of their country but invading and occupying parts of
Germany itself, securing victory in World War 2..</p>
<h3
id="importance-of-the-ussr---resources-and-production-the-soviet-war-economy-europe">Importance
of the USSR - Resources and Production: The Soviet War Economy
(Europe)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-measures-taken-by-the-ussr">Example and
Explanation (Measures taken by the USSR)</h4>
<p>To ensure production kept up with the high demand needed by the Red
Army in its fight against the Germans, the Soviets enacted harsh
measures. For example, adults in the USSR received no food unless they
worked in some way for the war effort. This applied to men and women –
half of the Soviet workforce was female. Forced labour was also used and
the secret police kept close control of the population.</p>
<h4 id="link-measures-taken-by-the-ussr">Link (Measures taken by the
USSR)</h4>
<p>These measures allowed the Soviet Red Army to not only continue to
oppose the invading Germans but also steadily grow in strength. Strength
that ultimately allowed it to turn the tide and not only push the
invaders out of the Soviet Union but to launch a counterattack that saw
them invading and occupying parts of Germany itself, securing victory in
World War 2.</p>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-role-of-the-ussrs-allies">Example and
Explanation (Role of the USSR's allies)</h4>
<p>The USSR's allies also made important contributions to the campaign.
Britain and the United States supplied vast amounts of food, raw
materials and industrial equipment via shipping routes despite the
U-boat threat from Germany. The United States provided the USSR with
over 500,000 motor vehicles and 1,900 locomotives and half of its supply
of rubber tyres and copper.</p>
<h4 id="link-role-of-the-ussrs-allies">Link (Role of the USSR's
allies)</h4>
<p>This aid allowed the Soviet Red Army to not only continue to oppose
the invading Germans but also steadily grow in strength. Strength that
ultimately allowed it to turn the tide and not only push the invaders
out of the Soviet Union but to launch a counterattack that saw them
invading and occupying parts of Germany itself, securing victory in
WW2.</p>
<h3
id="importance-of-the-ussr---entry-to-the-asia-pacific-the-asia-pacific">Importance
of the USSR - Entry to the Asia-Pacific (The Asia Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-6">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>As agreed at the Tehran Conference and Yalta Conference, the USSR
entered the war against Japan three months after the defeat of Germany.
Despite being part of the Allied forces, the USSR did not take part in
the war against Japan in the Asia-Pacific until 1945. This was because
Japan and the USSR had signed the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact in
1941 which was to be upheld for five years. On 8 August 1945, the
Soviets declared war against Japan and launched their invasion
simultaneously on three fronts of Manchuria.</p>
<h4 id="link-6">Link</h4>
<p>The Soviets were able to defeat the Kwantung Army in Manchuria and
occupy northern Korea, which contributed to Japan’s decision to
surrender to the Allied forces.</p>
<h2 id="weaknesses-of-the-axis-powers">Weaknesses of the Axis
Powers</h2>
<h3
id="germanys-military-weaknesses---hitlers-mistakes-europe">Germany’s
Military Weaknesses - Hitler’s Mistakes (Europe)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-7">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>The Germans made several critical errors in their campaigns, largely
due to an inefficient command structure. German commanders constantly
had to report back to Hitler, who regularly intervened in military
decisions. One example of such is his declaration of war on the United
States. Hitler erroneously decided to declare war on the United States
four days after the Pearl Harbor attack, despite having no obligation to
do so under the terms of the Tripartite Pact signed with Japan and
Italy. This move essentially brought the United States, which had been
neutral, into the European theatre of war. Germany would now have to
contend with the immense amount of resources and military might brought
about by the United States, one of the most industrialised countries in
the world.</p>
<h4 id="link-7">Link</h4>
<p>While Hitler may have been a shrewd politician, he had never been a
senior military commander. He had little military command experience at
the highest level. Thus, the mistakes he made as a result of this
inexperience contributed to the Axis defeat in World War 2.</p>
<h3
id="germanys-military-weaknesses---the-two-front-war-europe">Germany’s
Military Weaknesses - The Two-Front War (Europe)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-8">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>In WWI, Germany had tried to avoid a war on two fronts – against
Russia in the east and against Britain and France in the west. In 1940,
Hitler successfully fought a single-front war against Britain and
France, but he failed to defeat Britain. When he invaded the USSR in
1941, he placed Germany in a two-front war. This prevented him from
concentrating his efforts and resources on a single front. It could even
be argued that Germany was fighting on three fronts if we consider the
Allied bombing campaign. Besides, Germany was not just facing Britain on
the Western Front, but the United States for most of the war.</p>
<h4 id="link-8">Link</h4>
<p>Thus by allowing the war to become a two-front war, the Germans put
themselves in the position of being gradually worn down by the Allied
forces. This strongly contributed to the Allied victory in World War
2.</p>
<h3 id="germanys-military-weaknesses---poor-planning-europe">Germany’s
Military Weaknesses - Poor Planning (Europe)</h3>
<h4 id="explanation-and-link-naval-warfare">Explanation and Link (Naval
Warfare)</h4>
<p>Germany suffered from poor planning in regards to its navy. While the
Germans’ use of U-boats was highly effective, their use of surface ships
was less so.They put too many resources into building giant battleships,
such as Bismarck and Tirpitz, and failed to build aircraft carriers.</p>
<h4 id="link-naval-warfare">Link (Naval Warfare)</h4>
<p>These weaknesses in its navy led Germany to defeat and the Battle of
the Atlantic, which meant it was unable to cut off Britain and the
Soviet Union from the vital supply of American resources shipped across
the ocean. This failure ultimately contributed to its defeat in World
War 2.</p>
<h4 id="explanation-and-link-air-power">Explanation and Link (Air
Power)</h4>
<p>Germany suffered from poor planning in regards to its air force. From
1942 to 1945, the RAF and the US Air Force bombed Germany relentlessly.
The Germans never developed heavy bombers like the RAF’s Lancaster or
the US’ B-17, which could do severe damage to towns and cities. German
bombers were too small and could not carry enough bombs. Also, in the
Battle of Britain, the RAF had the advantage of radar, which the Germans
had not invested in. The RAF also had plenty of fuel, ammunition and
spare parts. On the other hand, shortages in these resources plagued the
Luftwaffe.</p>
<h4 id="link-air-power">Link (Air Power)</h4>
<p>These weaknesses in its air force put it a major disadvantage against
the Allies that it could not overcome, ultimately contributed to its
defeat in World War 2.</p>
<h3
id="japans-military-weaknesses---inter-service-rivalry-the-asia-pacific">Japan’s
Military Weaknesses - Inter-Service Rivalry (The Asia-Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-9">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>The Japanese army and navy had a long-term conflict with each other
since the Meiji period. In the 1930s, both services of the Japanese
military had different strategic goals and ideas for how they wanted to
seize territories to obtain resources to sustain Japan’s economy. When
the war broke out, the rivalry between the army and navy prevented both
groups from sharing resources and exchanging military intelligence, much
less coordinate their attacks and defences against the Allies. For
example, in 1942, when the navy asked the army to provide troop support
for an invasion of Australia, the army refused. Furthermore, the army
remained unresponsive throughout the Pacific War and was late to
recognise the threat of the US counteroffensive in late 1942.</p>
<h4 id="link-9">Link</h4>
<p>This rivalry prevented the Japanese from making the best use of its
resources, putting it a disadvantage and thus contributing to their
defeat by the Allies.</p>
<h3
id="japans-military-weaknesses---overstretched-empire-the-asia-pacific">Japan’s
Military Weaknesses - Overstretched Empire (The Asia-Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-10">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>The Japanese were unable to effectively leverage the empire they had
expanded from 1931 to 1941. The Japanese empire was very spread out. In
many areas, rail and road communications were poor, so it was difficult
to deliver raw materials and workers efficiently to the places where
they were needed.</p>
<h4 id="link-10">Link</h4>
<p>This inability to effectively allocate its resources due to its size
meant that the Japanese empire was a disadvantage and thus contributing
to its defeat by the Allies.</p>
<h3
id="japans-military-weaknesses---poor-planning-the-asia-pacific">Japan’s
Military Weaknesses - Poor Planning (The Asia-Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-11">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>The Japanese failed to understand that the war at sea had changed by
1941. Air power, in the form of aircraft based on carriers, was now far
more important than traditional naval power like battleships. Therefore,
while the Japanese damaged US battleships during the attack on Pearl
Harbor, they did not destroy any US aircraft carriers, as they were not
located at the base. This outcome allowed the US Navy to recover from
the attack quickly.</p>
<h4 id="link-11">Link</h4>
<p>This failure to recognize that the nature of naval warfare had
changed and adapt to a focus on carrier based combat meant that the
Japanese empire was a disadvantage and thus contributing to its defeat
by the Allies.</p>
<h3
id="japans-military-weaknesses---lack-of-local-support-the-asia-pacific">Japan’s
Military Weaknesses - Lack of Local Support (The Asia-Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="examples-and-explanation">Examples and Explanation</h4>
<p>The Japanese were unable to make the best use of their empire because
of how brutally they had treated the peoples they conquered. They looted
the resources of the conquered lands. They also abused the locals and
forced thousands into slave labour. This resulted in millions of
civilian deaths under Japanese rule. As a result, the conquered peoples
began to resist in any way they could against the Japanese. For example,
in Vietnam, the nationalist leader Ho Chi Minh led the Viet Minh in a
guerrilla campaign which gradually wore down the Japanese.</p>
<h4 id="link-12">Link</h4>
<p>This lack of local support within its empire meant that the Japanese
could not effectively extract the resources it needed from its the
territory it controlled. That said lack of support also often led to
outright resistance also drained Japanese military forces as they would
be required to be redeployed to suppress such forces. This thus caused
the Japanese Japanese empire was put at a disadvantage and contributed
to its defeat by the Allies.</p>

The Germans had advanced again in 1942 towards the city of Stalingrad.
Here, the Soviets held them in a fierce battle and, despite suffering
heavy casualties, were eventually able to encircle the Germans, forcing
them to surrender.</p>
<h4 id="link-resistance-1">Link (Resistance)</h4>
<p>This victory raised the morale of the Soviets as they began to drive
the Germans back. A counterattack that led to them not only pushing the
invaders out of their country but invading and occupying parts of
Germany itself, securing victory in World War 2..</p>

<h4 id="example-and-explanation-measures-taken-by-the-ussr-1">Example
and Explanation (Measures taken by the USSR)</h4>
<p>To ensure production kept up with the high demand needed by the Red
Army in its fight against the Germans, the Soviets enacted harsh
measures. For example, adults in the USSR received no food unless they
worked in some way for the war effort. This applied to men and women –
half of the Soviet workforce was female. Forced labour was also used and
the secret police kept close control of the population.</p>
<h4 id="link-measures-taken-by-the-ussr-1">Link (Measures taken by the
USSR)</h4>
<p>These measures allowed the Soviet Red Army to not only continue to
oppose the invading Germans but also steadily grow in strength. Strength
that ultimately allowed it to turn the tide and not only push the
invaders out of the Soviet Union but to launch a counterattack that saw
them invading and occupying parts of Germany itself, securing victory in
World War 2.</p>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-role-of-the-ussrs-allies-1">Example and

<p>The USSR's allies also made important contributions to the campaign.
Britain and the United States supplied vast amounts of food, raw
materials and industrial equipment via shipping routes despite the
U-boat threat from Germany. The United States provided the USSR with
over 500,000 motor vehicles and 1,900 locomotives and half of its supply
of rubber tyres and copper.</p>
<h4 id="link-role-of-the-ussrs-allies-1">Link (Role of the USSR's

<p>This aid allowed the Soviet Red Army to not only continue to oppose

<h4 id="example-and-explanation-18">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>As agreed at the Tehran Conference and Yalta Conference, the USSR
entered the war against Japan three months after the defeat of Germany.
Despite being part of the Allied forces, the USSR did not take part in
the war against Japan in the Asia-Pacific until 1945. This was because
Japan and the USSR had signed the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact in
1941 which was to be upheld for five years. On 8 August 1945, the
Soviets declared war against Japan and launched their invasion
simultaneously on three fronts of Manchuria.</p>
<h4 id="link-19">Link</h4>
<p>The Soviets were able to defeat the Kwantung Army in Manchuria and
occupy northern Korea, which contributed to Japan’s decision to
surrender to the Allied forces.</p>

<h3
id="germanys-military-weaknesses---hitlers-mistakes-europe-1">Germany’s
Military Weaknesses - Hitler’s Mistakes (Europe)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-19">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>The Germans made several critical errors in their campaigns, largely
due to an inefficient command structure. German commanders constantly
had to report back to Hitler, who regularly intervened in military
decisions. One example of such is his declaration of war on the United
States. Hitler erroneously decided to declare war on the United States
four days after the Pearl Harbor attack, despite having no obligation to
do so under the terms of the Tripartite Pact signed with Japan and
Italy. This move essentially brought the United States, which had been
neutral, into the European theatre of war. Germany would now have to
contend with the immense amount of resources and military might brought
about by the United States, one of the most industrialised countries in
the world.</p>
<h4 id="link-20">Link</h4>
<p>While Hitler may have been a shrewd politician, he had never been a
senior military commander. He had little military command experience at
the highest level. Thus, the mistakes he made as a result of this
inexperience contributed to the Axis defeat in World War 2.</p>
<h3
id="germanys-military-weaknesses---the-two-front-war-europe-1">Germany’s
Military Weaknesses - The Two-Front War (Europe)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-20">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>In WWI, Germany had tried to avoid a war on two fronts – against
Russia in the east and against Britain and France in the west. In 1940,
Hitler successfully fought a single-front war against Britain and
France, but he failed to defeat Britain. When he invaded the USSR in
1941, he placed Germany in a two-front war. This prevented him from
concentrating his efforts and resources on a single front. It could even
be argued that Germany was fighting on three fronts if we consider the
Allied bombing campaign. Besides, Germany was not just facing Britain on
the Western Front, but the United States for most of the war.</p>
<h4 id="link-21">Link</h4>
<p>Thus by allowing the war to become a two-front war, the Germans put
themselves in the position of being gradually worn down by the Allied
forces. This strongly contributed to the Allied victory in World War
2.</p>
<h3 id="germanys-military-weaknesses---poor-planning-europe-1">Germany’s
Military Weaknesses - Poor Planning (Europe)</h3>
<h4 id="explanation-and-link-naval-warfare-1">Explanation and Link
(Naval Warfare)</h4>
<p>Germany suffered from poor planning in regards to its navy. While the
Germans’ use of U-boats was highly effective, their use of surface ships
was less so.They put too many resources into building giant battleships,
such as Bismarck and Tirpitz, and failed to build aircraft carriers.</p>
<h4 id="link-naval-warfare-1">Link (Naval Warfare)</h4>
<p>These weaknesses in its navy led Germany to defeat and the Battle of
the Atlantic, which meant it was unable to cut off Britain and the
Soviet Union from the vital supply of American resources shipped across
the ocean. This failure ultimately contributed to its defeat in World
War 2.</p>
<h4 id="explanation-and-link-air-power-1">Explanation and Link (Air
Power)</h4>
<p>Germany suffered from poor planning in regards to its air force. From
1942 to 1945, the RAF and the US Air Force bombed Germany relentlessly.
The Germans never developed heavy bombers like the RAF’s Lancaster or
the US’ B-17, which could do severe damage to towns and cities. German
bombers were too small and could not carry enough bombs. Also, in the
Battle of Britain, the RAF had the advantage of radar, which the Germans
had not invested in. The RAF also had plenty of fuel, ammunition and
spare parts. On the other hand, shortages in these resources plagued the
Luftwaffe.</p>
<h4 id="link-air-power-1">Link (Air Power)</h4>
<p>These weaknesses in its air force put it a major disadvantage against
the Allies that it could not overcome, ultimately contributed to its
defeat in World War 2.</p>
<h3
id="japans-military-weaknesses---inter-service-rivalry-the-asia-pacific-1">Japan’s
Military Weaknesses - Inter-Service Rivalry (The Asia-Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-21">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>The Japanese army and navy had a long-term conflict with each other
since the Meiji period. In the 1930s, both services of the Japanese
military had different strategic goals and ideas for how they wanted to
seize territories to obtain resources to sustain Japan’s economy. When
the war broke out, the rivalry between the army and navy prevented both
groups from sharing resources and exchanging military intelligence, much
less coordinate their attacks and defences against the Allies. For
example, in 1942, when the navy asked the army to provide troop support
for an invasion of Australia, the army refused. Furthermore, the army
remained unresponsive throughout the Pacific War and was late to
recognise the threat of the US counteroffensive in late 1942.</p>
<h4 id="link-22">Link</h4>
<p>This rivalry prevented the Japanese from making the best use of its
resources, putting it a disadvantage and thus contributing to their
defeat by the Allies.</p>
<h3
id="japans-military-weaknesses---overstretched-empire-the-asia-pacific-1">Japan’s
Military Weaknesses - Overstretched Empire (The Asia-Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-22">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>The Japanese were unable to effectively leverage the empire they had
expanded from 1931 to 1941. The Japanese empire was very spread out. In
many areas, rail and road communications were poor, so it was difficult
to deliver raw materials and workers efficiently to the places where
they were needed.</p>
<h4 id="link-23">Link</h4>
<p>This inability to effectively allocate its resources due to its size
meant that the Japanese empire was a disadvantage and thus contributing
to its defeat by the Allies.</p>
<h3
id="japans-military-weaknesses---poor-planning-the-asia-pacific-1">Japan’s
Military Weaknesses - Poor Planning (The Asia-Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="example-and-explanation-23">Example and Explanation</h4>
<p>The Japanese failed to understand that the war at sea had changed by
1941. Air power, in the form of aircraft based on carriers, was now far
more important than traditional naval power like battleships. Therefore,
while the Japanese damaged US battleships during the attack on Pearl
Harbor, they did not destroy any US aircraft carriers, as they were not
located at the base. This outcome allowed the US Navy to recover from
the attack quickly.</p>
<h4 id="link-24">Link</h4>
<p>This failure to recognize that the nature of naval warfare had
changed and adapt to a focus on carrier based combat meant that the
Japanese empire was a disadvantage and thus contributing to its defeat
by the Allies.</p>
<h3
id="japans-military-weaknesses---lack-of-local-support-the-asia-pacific-1">Japan’s
Military Weaknesses - Lack of Local Support (The Asia-Pacific)</h3>
<h4 id="examples-and-explanation-1">Examples and Explanation</h4>
<p>The Japanese were unable to make the best use of their empire because
of how brutally they had treated the peoples they conquered. They looted
the resources of the conquered lands. They also abused the locals and
forced thousands into slave labour. This resulted in millions of
civilian deaths under Japanese rule. As a result, the conquered peoples
began to resist in any way they could against the Japanese. For example,
in Vietnam, the nationalist leader Ho Chi Minh led the Viet Minh in a
guerrilla campaign which gradually wore down the Japanese.</p>
<h4 id="link-25">Link</h4>
<p>This lack of local support within its empire meant that the Japanese
could not effectively extract the resources it needed from its the
territory it controlled. That said lack of support also often led to
outright resistance also drained Japanese military forces as they would
be required to be redeployed to suppress such forces. This thus caused
the Japanese Japanese empire was put at a disadvantage and contributed
to its defeat by the Allies.</p>
