<h2 id="responses-of-individuals">Responses of Individuals</h2>
<p>Individuals can play their part and respond by contributing their
time, effort and money to meet areas of need in society. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can start ground-up initiatives and mobilise resources to
distribute food to those in need.</li>
<li>They can also volunteer with existing organisations to provide
services to other groups in society, such as helping out at mobile
clinics.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="responses-of-community-groups">Responses of Community
Groups</h2>
<p>In a socio-economically diverse country like Singapore, there are
some groups in society who may not have enough resources and
opportunities to progress. This can lead to challenges with accessing
healthcare and education, which can affect their quality of life and
opportunities for social mobility.</p>
<p>Formal and informal community groups can step in by providing support
in the form of financial aid, guidance and resources.</p>

<h2 id="responses-of-governments">Responses of Governments</h2>
<p>Different governments adopt different approaches to manage the issues
related to socio-economic diversity. In this section, you will explore
aspects of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the government-financed approach adopted in Sweden; and</li>
<li>the shared-responsibility approach adopted in Singapore</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="government-financed-approach-in-sweden">Government-financed
Approach in Sweden</h3>
<h4 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h4>
<p>Healthcare services such as hospital care, medicine, dental care,
disability support and rehabilitation services are publicly funded.</p>
<ul>
<li>All families are covered by a medical protection scheme.</li>
<li>Children in the household can claim up to 2,466 Swedish kronor
(about $330) in a year from the government.</li>
<li>Since 2019, dental care costs are free for local residents up to the
age of 23. Dental care from the age of 24 is subsidised.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="education">Education</h4>
<p>Education is funded by the government and provided to all Swedes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Education is compulsory from ages 6 to 16.
<ul>
<li>Sweden provides a free school lunch to every child.</li>
<li>All students have access to a school doctor, school nurse,
psychologist and school welfare officer at no cost.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tuition fees for tertiary education are fully subsidised for Swedish
residents.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="housing">Housing</h4>
<p>Allowance is provided to lower-income individuals or families who
need help to pay for housing or housing fees for their own home.</p>
<ul>
<li>Families may receive housing allowance if they live with children
and pay more than 1,400 Swedish kronor (about $190) for their
housing.</li>
<li>For the elderly with low or no income, they are entitled to a
housing supplement which acts as a form of financial support.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="skills-training">Skills Training</h4>
<p>The Swedish Public Employment Service provides training to equip
individuals with skills to increase their chances of employment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Free vocational courses are provided to train individuals from
diverse backgrounds for industries that lack skilled workers.</li>
<li>Applicants for these courses must be registered as a job seeker with
the Swedish Public Employment Service.</li>
<li>Applicants must be:
<ul>
<li>above 25 years old;</li>
<li>under 25 years old and have a disability; or</li>
<li>over 18 years and have circumstances that make it difficult for them
to be employed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In Sweden's government-financed approach, the provision of
substantial assistance and financial support ensures that citizens and
individuals of different socio-economic backgrounds have access to
healthcare, education, housing and employment. This also ensures that
the needs of the elderly, citizens with illnesses or disabilities, and
those with young children are provided for.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-faced-by-sweden">Challenges faced by Sweden</h3>
<h4 id="high-taxation-rate">High Taxation Rate</h4>
<p>The social benefits provided by the Swedish government, such as
lengthy parental leave, unemployment allowances, healthcare and free
education, are made possible by the high taxation rate in Sweden.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2019, the highest income earners in Sweden pay income taxes of
57.2 per cent, which is one of the highest in the world.</li>
<li>Besides direct taxation in the form of income tax, there is also
indirect taxation in the form of Value-Added Tax (VAT), which is similar
to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Singapore. In 2019, VAT in Sweden
was 25 per cent.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ageing-population">Ageing Population</h4>
<p>Swedish elder care is largely funded by taxes and government grants.
In 2018, the total cost of elder care in Sweden was 126.3 billion kronor
($17.2 billion). This amount is set to increase as the country's
population continues to age.</p>
<p>Sweden's life expectancy is one of the highest in the world - 80.6
years for men and close to 84.3 years for women. More than 5 per cent of
Sweden's population is aged 80 or older. With an ageing population and
high life expectancy, government spending will increase over time,
especially in the areas of health and long-term care.</p>
<p>However, as more people retire, it will be a smaller working
population to bear this increased cost. There will be a need to increase
employment rates, lengthen the employment years of those still working,
or raise taxes on the working population.</p>
<h4 id="high-immigrant-unemployment-rates">High immigrant unemployment
rates</h4>
<p>Sweden has one of the larger immigrant populations among the European
countries. However, there are several challenges in integrating
immigrants into the workforce, which widens the income gap between them
and other citizens.</p>
<h5 id="challenges-integrating-immigrants-into-the-workplace">Challenges
integrating immigrants into the workplace</h5>
<h6 id="mismatch-between-skills-and-jobs">Mismatch between skills and
jobs</h6>
<ul>
<li>Immigrants may not have received educational opportunities in their
home countries, leaving them unable to take up unfilled jobs in
Sweden.</li>
<li>This has resulted in high unemployment for low-skilled workers and
immigrants</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="difficulty-in-assessing-skills">Difficulty in assessing
skills</h6>
<ul>
<li>If an immigrant's training experience was not in Sweden, employers
have difficulties assessing their actual competency.</li>
<li>The processing time for foreign qualifications is long.</li>
<li>These have resulted in highly educated immigrants with foreign
qualifications facing challenges in finding suitable jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="shared-responsibility-approach-in-singapore">Shared-responsibility
approach in Singapore</h3>
<p>Singapore adopts a shared-responsibility approach where many helping
hands such as individuals and families, community groups and the
government work together to address issues related to socio-economic
diversity and meet the needs of society.</p>
<p>Individuals play an important role in making the effort to support
themselves and their family members. However, some individuals may not
have enough resources to take care of themselves or their family
members. Hence, community groups and the government step in to support
them.</p>
<p>The government provides targeted assistance to individuals and
families who are unable to provide for themselves and where support from
community groups is inadequate. This targeted assistance takes the form
of subsidies, financial assistance and skills training to increase their
employability.</p>
<h4 id="subsidies-for-essential-services">Subsidies for essential
services</h4>
<h5 id="healthcare-1">Healthcare</h5>
<ul>
<li>One example is Singapore's healthcare financing system, which
emphasises individual responsibility and affordable healthcare for all.
<ul>
<li>The government adopts multiple tiers of protection to ensure
accessible and affordable healthcare for all Singaporeans.
<ul>
<li>Government Subsidies
<ul>
<li>Helps to reduce the cost to the patient. For hospitalisation in
public hospitals, subsidy goes up to 80%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MediShield Life
<ul>
<li>Pays for large hospital bills and selected outpatient
treatments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MediSave
<ul>
<li>Helps to pay for your medical expenses or that of your immediate
family members.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MediFund
<ul>
<li>Helps those who are unable to afford their subsidised medical
bills.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>While Singaporeans save for their own or their dependents'
healthcare needs through the CPF MediSave Account, the government
provides subsidies to reduce medical costs for Singaporeans</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="education-1">Education</h5>
<ul>
<li>Another example takes the form of preschool subsidies to ensure that
all children have access to quality education for a good start in life,
regardless of their family background.
<ul>
<li>While parents pay for preschool fees, government subsidies across
all eligible income tiers have increased.</li>
<li>From January 2020, lower-income families earning $3000 or less per
month pay $3 per month at preschool centres under the Anchor Operator
Scheme funded by the government.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="housing-1">Housing</h5>
<ul>
<li>Public housing subsidies are also provided to ensure affordable
housing opportunities for Singaporeans.
<ul>
<li>While Singaporeans pay for their home purchase in cash or with their
CPF savings, the government has put in place various housing grant and
rental housing schemes to ensure that housing opportunities are kept
affordable for Singaporeans.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5
id="social-and-community-assistance-to-provide-targeted-support-for-lower-income-singaporeans">Social
and community assistance to provide targeted support for lower-income
Singaporeans</h5>
<ul>
<li>Long-term assistance is provided for persons who are permanently
unable to work due to old age, illness or disability and have little to
no income, savings and family support.</li>
<li>Short-to-medium-term financial support is provided to help families
and individuals tide over difficult times and regain stability.</li>
</ul>
<h5
id="vouchers-to-provide-more-support-for-lower-to-middle-income-singaporean-households">Vouchers
to provide more support for lower to middle-income Singaporean
households</h5>
<ul>
<li>Some areas of support provided by the permanent GST Voucher scheme
are:
<ul>
<li>Some cash payouts in August every year to support lower-income
Singaporeans with their immediate needs.</li>
<li>Quarterly U-save rebates to help lower and middle-income HDB
households offset their utility bills.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="opportunities-for-upskilling-and-training">Opportunities for
upskilling and training</h5>
<ul>
<li>The programs and initiatives under SkillsFuture Singapore gives
students and working adults access to training and courses to
continually upskill and equip themselves with industry-relevant
skills.</li>
<li>The Workfare Skills Support scheme provides training allowance and
cash awards to encourage low-wage Singaporeans to upgrade their
skills.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="challenges-faced-by-singapore">Challenges faced by
Singapore</h3>
<h4 id="ageing-population-1">Ageing Population</h4>
<p>By 2030, the percentage of seniors will more than double, while
citizens aged 20 to 63 will decrease. This will increase demands on
government funding for healthcare and other social services to meet the
needs of a larger ageing population.</p>
<p>With a life expectancy of close to 85 years, Singaporeans are living
longer. Between 2010 and 2019, the government tripled its healthcare
expenditure to $11.3 billion to meet the growing needs of seniors and
ensure that every Singaporean has access to affordable and quality
healthcare.</p>
<p>The increasingly heavy cost of supporting an ageing population would
affect the working population. With fewer working adults supporting more
older people, the cost each working adult needs to shoulder would be
higher.</p>
<p>Having fewer working adults would also affect the vibrancy of
Singapore's economy. There would be lower productivity, which may lead
to decreased economic output. This would result in slower economic
growth for the country. If this happens, Singapore would not be able to
sustain its resources to care for the elderly and people in need.</p>
<h4 id="increase-in-taxation">Increase in taxation</h4>
<p>The Singapore government plans to increase the GST from 7 to 9 per
cent gradually from 2023 to 2024. The higher government revenue will
help to meet the needs of the population, particularly in healthcare
spending.</p>
<p>In Singapore, higher-income earners pay a proportionally higher tax,
with the highest personal income tax rate at 22 per cent as at 2021. It
is estimated that more than 60 per cent of tax earned from households
and individuals is paid by foreigners residing in Singapore, tourists
and the top 20 percent of resident households.</p>
<p>Singapore's competitive tax rates are attractive to high earners and
entrepreneurs who want to live and do business in Singapore. If taxes
keep increasing, this may deter foreigners and tourists from residing in
or coming to Singapore.</p>
<h4 id="limitations-in-upskilling-and-training">Limitations in
upskilling and training</h4>
<p>In the annual pre-budget 2020 Feedback Exercise conducted by REACH, a
governmental feedback unit, many respondents who were aged 60 and above
shared that they were not sure if attending courses would be sufficient
to increase their chances of employment. They also shared that a mindset
shift in employers would also be needed so that older workers are
valued, accepted and accommodated.</p>
<p>By 2030, with the retirement age set at 65 and re-employment age at
70, mature workers will need more support to continue working for
longer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Without employment support for mature workers, it would be hard for
employers to retain and hire them.</li>
<li>They may also not be able to advance in their jobs, earning wages
that may not be enough to support their needs.</li>

<ul>
<li>If an immigrant's training experience was not in Sweden, employers
have difficulties assessing their actual competency.</li>
<li>The processing time for foreign qualifications is long.</li>
<li>These have resulted in highly educated immigrants with foreign
qualifications facing challenges in finding suitable jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="shared-responsibility-approach-in-singapore-1">Shared-responsibility
approach in Singapore</h3>
<p>Singapore adopts a shared-responsibility approach where many helping
hands such as individuals and families, community groups and the
government work together to address issues related to socio-economic
diversity and meet the needs of society.</p>
<p>Individuals play an important role in making the effort to support
themselves and their family members. However, some individuals may not
have enough resources to take care of themselves or their family
members. Hence, community groups and the government step in to support
them.</p>
<p>The government provides targeted assistance to individuals and
families who are unable to provide for themselves and where support from
community groups is inadequate. This targeted assistance takes the form
of subsidies, financial assistance and skills training to increase their
employability.</p>
<h4 id="subsidies-for-essential-services-1">Subsidies for essential
services</h4>
<h5 id="healthcare-3">Healthcare</h5>
<ul>
<li>One example is Singapore's healthcare financing system, which
emphasises individual responsibility and affordable healthcare for all.
<ul>
<li>The government adopts multiple tiers of protection to ensure
accessible and affordable healthcare for all Singaporeans.
<ul>
<li>Government Subsidies
<ul>
<li>Helps to reduce the cost to the patient. For hospitalisation in
public hospitals, subsidy goes up to 80%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MediShield Life
<ul>
<li>Pays for large hospital bills and selected outpatient
treatments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MediSave
<ul>
<li>Helps to pay for your medical expenses or that of your immediate
family members.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MediFund
<ul>
<li>Helps those who are unable to afford their subsidised medical
bills.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>While Singaporeans save for their own or their dependents'
healthcare needs through the CPF MediSave Account, the government
provides subsidies to reduce medical costs for Singaporeans</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="education-3">Education</h5>
<ul>
<li>Another example takes the form of preschool subsidies to ensure that
all children have access to quality education for a good start in life,
regardless of their family background.
<ul>
<li>While parents pay for preschool fees, government subsidies across
all eligible income tiers have increased.</li>
<li>From January 2020, lower-income families earning $3000 or less per
month pay $3 per month at preschool centres under the Anchor Operator
Scheme funded by the government.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="housing-3">Housing</h5>
<ul>
<li>Public housing subsidies are also provided to ensure affordable
housing opportunities for Singaporeans.
<ul>
<li>While Singaporeans pay for their home purchase in cash or with their
CPF savings, the government has put in place various housing grant and
rental housing schemes to ensure that housing opportunities are kept
affordable for Singaporeans.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5
id="social-and-community-assistance-to-provide-targeted-support-for-lower-income-singaporeans-1">Social
and community assistance to provide targeted support for lower-income
Singaporeans</h5>
<ul>
<li>Long-term assistance is provided for persons who are permanently
unable to work due to old age, illness or disability and have little to
no income, savings and family support.</li>
<li>Short-to-medium-term financial support is provided to help families
and individuals tide over difficult times and regain stability.</li>
</ul>
<h5
id="vouchers-to-provide-more-support-for-lower-to-middle-income-singaporean-households-1">Vouchers
to provide more support for lower to middle-income Singaporean
households</h5>
<ul>
<li>Some areas of support provided by the permanent GST Voucher scheme
are:
<ul>
<li>Some cash payouts in August every year to support lower-income
Singaporeans with their immediate needs.</li>
<li>Quarterly U-save rebates to help lower and middle-income HDB
households offset their utility bills.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="opportunities-for-upskilling-and-training-1">Opportunities for
upskilling and training</h5>
<ul>
<li>The programs and initiatives under SkillsFuture Singapore gives
students and working adults access to training and courses to
continually upskill and equip themselves with industry-relevant
skills.</li>
<li>The Workfare Skills Support scheme provides training allowance and
cash awards to encourage low-wage Singaporeans to upgrade their
skills.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="challenges-faced-by-singapore-1">Challenges faced by
Singapore</h3>
<h4 id="ageing-population-3">Ageing Population</h4>
<p>By 2030, the percentage of seniors will more than double, while
citizens aged 20 to 63 will decrease. This will increase demands on
government funding for healthcare and other social services to meet the
needs of a larger ageing population.</p>
<p>With a life expectancy of close to 85 years, Singaporeans are living
longer. Between 2010 and 2019, the government tripled its healthcare
expenditure to $11.3 billion to meet the growing needs of seniors and
ensure that every Singaporean has access to affordable and quality
healthcare.</p>
<p>The increasingly heavy cost of supporting an ageing population would
affect the working population. With fewer working adults supporting more
older people, the cost each working adult needs to shoulder would be
higher.</p>
<p>Having fewer working adults would also affect the vibrancy of
Singapore's economy. There would be lower productivity, which may lead
to decreased economic output. This would result in slower economic
growth for the country. If this happens, Singapore would not be able to
sustain its resources to care for the elderly and people in need.</p>
<h4 id="increase-in-taxation-1">Increase in taxation</h4>
<p>The Singapore government plans to increase the GST from 7 to 9 per
cent gradually from 2023 to 2024. The higher government revenue will
help to meet the needs of the population, particularly in healthcare
spending.</p>
<p>In Singapore, higher-income earners pay a proportionally higher tax,
with the highest personal income tax rate at 22 per cent as at 2021. It
is estimated that more than 60 per cent of tax earned from households
and individuals is paid by foreigners residing in Singapore, tourists
and the top 20 percent of resident households.</p>
<p>Singapore's competitive tax rates are attractive to high earners and
entrepreneurs who want to live and do business in Singapore. If taxes
keep increasing, this may deter foreigners and tourists from residing in
or coming to Singapore.</p>
<h4 id="limitations-in-upskilling-and-training-1">Limitations in
upskilling and training</h4>
<p>In the annual pre-budget 2020 Feedback Exercise conducted by REACH, a
governmental feedback unit, many respondents who were aged 60 and above
shared that they were not sure if attending courses would be sufficient
to increase their chances of employment. They also shared that a mindset
shift in employers would also be needed so that older workers are
valued, accepted and accommodated.</p>
<p>By 2030, with the retirement age set at 65 and re-employment age at
70, mature workers will need more support to continue working for
longer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Without employment support for mature workers, it would be hard for
employers to retain and hire them.</li>
<li>They may also not be able to advance in their jobs, earning wages
that may not be enough to support their needs.</li>
</ul>
