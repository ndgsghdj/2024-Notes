<p><em>I agree with the statement as Source B supports it. Source B
states "the ACA will offer you a variety of quality, affordable, private
health insurance plans to choose from. Insurance companies will no
longer be able to discriminate against any American with a pre-existing
health condition". Because more individuals would be able to obtain
access to affordable insurance coverage, so their medical needs would be
addressed more promptly as individuals no longer have to worry about
being unable to afford the medical costs. As a result, the overall
health of the American population would increase as illnesses are
addressed more promptly and not allowed to deteriorate further, ensuring
that a larger proportion of the population remains healthy for a longer
period of time. Therefore, the American healthcare system has been
successful in meeting the healthcare needs of the public.</em></p>
