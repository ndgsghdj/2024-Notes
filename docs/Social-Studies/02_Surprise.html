<h2 id="l3-answer">L3 Answer</h2>
<p>I am not surprised by this source as source F and Source B share the
similar concern of the negative impact of globalisation on the society.
This is evident from Source F, which tells me that "children who have
access to TV prefer fancy western dress to our traditional dress" This
implies youths have strong preference for western clothing and
lifestyle. Similarly, this is seen in Source B, which tells me western
fashion has dominated everyone as we can see from the source, the
characters bought apparel from Nike, Gap, and Disney store. This
similarity makes it not surprising.</p>
<h2 id="l56-answer">L5/6 Answer</h2>
<p>I am not surprised by Source F. It is made by Professor of Bhutan and
Bhutan was a small mountainous kingdom, renowned for its rich tradition
and culture. In the face of globalisation, it is expected for the
professor to be protective of Bhutan's rich culture to prevent erosion
of Bhutanese culture as he highlighted although English is taught. "It
is quite embarrassing to see that our cultural identity and values have
diminished". In addition, he raised the concerns of western influences
impacting the society negatively with vices such as "smoking, drugs, and
gang fights" and also the erosion of culture as seen from "ignoring
traditional songs and dances." Thus, from his concerns, it is natural
for the government to implement a law to protect Bhutan form the
negative influences of globalisation, as the professor, just like the
government, is a firm believer/proponent of protecting Bhutan's culture.
Therefore justifying the need for the law.</p>
