Study Source A. What is the message of the source? Explain your
answer.</h2>
<p>One message is that the ageing population has an negative impact on
economic growth as it results in an economic slowdown in a country and
hence New Zealanders need to have the political will to support changes
to existing policies to cater to the needs of their population, despite
these measures being unpopular. This is evident in Source A which shows
the elderly population still working as construction workers, postman,
delivery workers which may be having issues with their productivity as
the workers seem lethargic and sleepy. In addition, the response from
the elderly couple indicating their choice of "Letting more people into
N.Z." shows that introducing younger foreign workers/new immigrants is a
viable way to boost the productivity in the economy.</p>
