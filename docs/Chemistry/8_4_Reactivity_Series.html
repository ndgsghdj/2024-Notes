<h3 id="extraction-of-metals">Extraction of Metals</h3>
<p>The process of getting metals from the ores is called the extraction
of metals.</p>
<p>The extraction process is as described:</p>
<p><img src="Reactivity_Series/figure1.png" alt="figure1" /></p>
<p>There are two main methods used to chemically extract the given metal
from its metal compounds.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Electrolysis:</strong> the melting of metal compounds and
the use of electricity to decompose the molten compound to obtain the
metal.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction by carbon/coke</strong>: Heating the metal
compound with carbon to obtain the pure metal. This is considered as
both a redox and a displacement reaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason why there are two different methods to extract metals
is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Metals have different reactivity.</li>
<li>Extraction methods have costs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only two metals, gold and platinum, are found principally in their
native states.</p>
<p>Many other metals naturally exist as metal compounds (such as
sulfides, oxides, and hydroxides) in ores.</p>
<p>As most metals are reactive, once they are exposed, they would react
with oxygen, water, etc. present in the surrounding to form metal
compounds.</p>
<p><img src="Reactivity_Series/figure2.png" alt="figure2" /></p>
<p><strong>In a nutshell:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Metals above carbon require extraction by electrolysis of molten
ore</li>
<li>Metals below carbon can be extracted by heating metal ore with
carbon.</li>
<li>Gold needs not be extracted chemically. It is found free (native)
metal in the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consolidation">Consolidation</h2>
<p>The method used to extract a given metal from its compound depends on
the reactivity of the metal and the stability of the ore.</p>
<p><img src="Reactivity_Series/figure3.png" alt="figure3" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain why the very reactive metals (metals above carbon) can only
be extracted by electrolysis and not by the reduction of its oxide by
carbon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These metals are more reactive (or more easily oxidised) than carbon
and cannot be extracted from their oxides by reduction of carbon.</p>
<p>These metals are very stable as ions in metal compounds. It is very
difficult to extract the metal from its compounds.</p>
<p>Electricity is needed to decompose the molten ionic compound to
obtain the metal (electrolysis)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain why the less reactive metals (metals below carbon) can be
extracted by reduction of their oxides by carbon (displacement
reaction).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These metals are less reactive (or less easily oxidised) than carbon
and can be displaced from their compounds by reduction with carbon to
obtain the metal.</p>

electrolysis is a very expensive process.)</em></p>

<h3 id="increasing-rate-of-rusting">Increasing rate of rusting</h3>
<ul>
<li>The rusting process involves the transfer of electrons</li>

<p><strong>How does this prevent rusting?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How does this prevent rusting?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The protective layer prevents the metal from contacting with water
and oxygen, thus reducing the rate of rusting</li>
<li>If the protective layer is scraped off/removed, the iron is exposed
to water and oxygen and rusting occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>machine, motor cars, bridges, ships</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coated with Tin:</strong></p>

<li>Cans for can food</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coated with Chromium""</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Taps, kettles, bicycles, handlebars</li>

steel</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Note: These blocks of <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Zn}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Mg}\)</span> metal have to be
replaced regularly once they have all been reacted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does this prevent rusting?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Zn}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\ce{Mg}\)</span> are more reactive than iron and
would react more readily with oxygen and corrode preferentially,
preventing the iron from rusting.</li>
<li>A coating layer of <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Zn}\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(\ce{Mg}\)</span> on the entire iron metal
surface is not necessary. As long as <span
class="math inline">\(\ce{Mg}\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\ce{Zn}\)</span> is present, iron will not
rust.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Underground pipes, ships, columns of steel piers</li>
