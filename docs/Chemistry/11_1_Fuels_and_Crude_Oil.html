bioresources and biofuels</h2>
<p>Bioresources are raw materials from human or animal activity that are
renewable and biodegradable, however, biofuels are fuels that may be
derived from bioresources, to be used as alternatives to conventional
fossil fuels.</p>

<p>It's plan is to blend the use of biomethane in larger quantities with

Factors for Consideration before Extensive Implementation of Use of
Biofuels in Singapore.</h2>

<li>Cost effectiveness in emissions reduction</li>
<li>Existing infrastructure for fuels and feedstocks</li>

one negative impact of the use of biofuel and bioresources on the
biodiversity, land use and carbon cycle.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Biodiversity : With the need for biofuel, there might be a tendency
to increase the production of certain types of crops. This will lead to
the loss of biodiversity and possible disruption in the natural
eco-systems.</li>
<li>Land use: With the demand for biofuel, there might be demand for
land use to grow such crops to meet the demand. There will be competing
uses for the land such as for agricultural needs to support food
compared to the fuel industry.</li>
<li>Carbon cycle: Deforestation and land conversion programmes to clear
and prepare the lands required to produce biofuel, may release
significant amount of CO2. This can offset the environmental
sustainability factor of biofuels of being carbon-neutral.</li>
