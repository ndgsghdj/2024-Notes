# Fuels and Crude Oil

> _Editor's note: wtf is this topic_

## Introduction to Fuels

- Fossil fuels are formed from decayed plants and animals from millions of years ago.
- They are mainly organic compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen, known as __hydrocarbons__
- Fossil fuels are important as they are the largest sources of energy for powering transport and electrical appliances, which are essential for us to function in our daily lives.
- When fossil fuels undergo combustion, heat is released as the reaction is an exothermic one. The thermal energy can then be converted to other forms of energy.
- __Crude oil__ and __natural gas__ are forms of fossil fuel.

## Fractional Distillation of Crude Oil

![figure1](Fuels_Crude_Oil/figure1.png)

- The different compounds in crude oil have different boiling points.
- Generally, hydrocarbons with larger relative molecular mass have higher boiling and melting points.
- As one moves up the fractionating tower, the temperature decreases.
    * Hydrocarbons boil and rise up the column until they reach the trays that are cool enough for them to condense (into liquids).
    * The liquids are siphoned off at different levels. Hence, hydrocarbon compounds with the highest boiling points will condense in trays __near the bottom of the fractionating column.__
        + Note that the liquid siphoned off at each level is called a __fraction__.
        + Every fraction comprises a __mixture__ of compounds, instead of pure substance.
- The lightest hydrocarbon (petroleum gas, which has the smallest relative molecular mass), does not condense and is collected at the top of the fractionating tower. It can also be used as a fuel.

> Mixture of crude oil is heated so that __it enters the fractionating column as a *gaseous mixture*__ &rarr; ALL the fractions exist as vapour at the same time and then __separate out by selectively condensing__
> __Note:__ During fractional distillation the liquids __DO NOT 'boil' or 'evaporate' one at a time__

## Difference between bioresources and biofuels

Bioresources are raw materials from human or animal activity that are renewable and biodegradable, however, biofuels are fuels that may be derived from bioresources, to be used as alternatives to conventional fossil fuels.

## Government's Plan to Support Domestic Power Generation

It's plan is to blend the use of biomethane in larger quantities with natural gas in the piped networks to support domestic power generation.

## Three Factors for Consideration before Extensive Implementation of Use of Biofuels in Singapore.

- Cost effectiveness in emissions reduction
- Existing infrastructure for fuels and feedstocks
- Suitability of applications for deployment by 2050.

## Suggest one negative impact of the use of biofuel and bioresources on the biodiversity, land use and carbon cycle.

- Biodiversity : With the need for biofuel, there might be a tendency to increase the production of certain types of crops. This will lead to the loss of biodiversity and possible disruption in the natural eco-systems.
- Land use: With the demand for biofuel, there might be demand for land use to grow such crops to meet the demand. There will be competing uses for the land such as for agricultural needs to support food compared to the fuel industry.
- Carbon cycle: Deforestation and land conversion programmes to clear and prepare the lands required to produce biofuel, may release significant amount of CO2. This can offset the environmental sustainability factor of biofuels of being carbon-neutral.

## Possible Contribution of Singapore in Future of Biofuel

Singapore could possibly be a leader in the importing of biofuels and refining them for export.

## Biofuels

- Biofuels are alternative renewable energy sources to crude oil and natural gas.
    * Biofuels are a renewable energy source that is derived from plant, algal or animal biomass.

## Carbon-Intensive Sectors

- Electricity generation
- Transport industry
- Heavy industry
    * Types of businesses that carry a high capital cost, high barriers to entry and low transportability, e.g. petrochemical industry, oil refining, aerospace and aviation.

## Organisation and Understanding of Biofuel

__Biofuel is a renewable energy source that is derived from plant, algal, or animal biomass.__

__Solid Biofuel:__
- Wood chips

__Liquid biofuel:__
- Biodiesel (from vegetable oil)
- Bioethanol (from sugarcane and corn)
__Gaseous biofuel__
- Biogas (from animal waste)

__Bioresources__ are raw materials from human or animal activity that are renewable and biodegradable.

Examples of bioresources are wood chips, vegetable oil, animal fats.

### Trends: Flammability (chemical)

#### Trend and Explanation

The flashpoints of the alkanes and alkenes generally increases as *relative molecular mass increases* &rarr; *flammability* decreases.
- larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces of attraction, thus less volatile (likelihood of existing as a gas)

# Alcohols and Carboxylic Acids

## Alcohols

__Functional Group:__

$$\ce{O-H}$$

__General Formula:__

$$\ce{C_n H_{2n+1} OH}$$

| Name     | Molecular Formula | Structural Formula                       |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Methanol | $\ce{CH_3 OH}$    | $\ce{CH_3 - O - H}$                      |
| Ethanol  | $\ce{C_2 H_5 OH}$ | $\ce{CH_3 - CH_2 - O - H}$               |

| Butanol  | $\ce{C_4 H_9 OH}$ | $\ce{CH_3 - CH_2 - CH_2 - CH_2 - O - H}$ |

## How are Alcohols Synthesised?

### Method A: Fermentation of Glucose

- Fermentation: chemical process in which __microorganisms__ such as yeast act on glucose to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide.
- Yeast contains __enzymes__ that catalyse the breakdown of glucose to form ethanol and carbon dioxide.

#### Balanced Chemical Equation

$$\ce{C_6 H_{12} O_6 (aq) ->[yeast] 2C_2H_5OH (aq) + 2CO_2 (g)}$$

#### Essential Conditions

- Temperature is kept at 37 degrees Celsius
- Absence of oxygen
- Enzymes in yeast

### Method B: Hydration of Alkanes

#### Essential Conditions

- High temperature and pressure (300 degrees Celsius, 60 atm), 
- $\ce{H_3 PO_4}$ catalyst

### Physical Properties of Alcohols

- Soluble in water
- Most are liquids at room temperature
- Alcohols with more carbon atoms (12 and above) are solids at room temperature

The ability to form hydrogen bonds (a type of intermolecular force) allows alcohols to interact with water molecules allowing it dissolves in water. More energy is also required to overcome the hydrogen bonds resulting in higher melting and boiling points of alcohol

#### Solubility of Alcohols

- Alkanes
    * All alkanes are insoluble in water.
    * Alcohols: solubility decreases as number of carbons in chain increases
- The alkyl group (carbon chain) is non-polar and cannot form hydrogen bonds with water. 
- The longer the carbon chain, the more insoluble the alcohol.

## How do Alcohols React?

Alcohols are generally more reactive than alkanes.
- The $\ce{C-O}$ and $\ce{O-H}$ bonds in alcohols are more reactive than the $\ce{C-C}$ and $\ce{C-H}$ bonds in alkanes

### Combustion of Alcohol

- Like all organic compounds, alcohols undergo combustion in the presence of oxygen and heat to produce __carbon dioxide and steam.__

$$\ce{C_2H_5OH (l) + 3O_2 (g) -> 2CO_2 (g) + 3H_2O(g)}$$

### Oxidation

$$\ce{C_3H_7OH ->[acidified\space KMnO_4] C_2H_5COOH}$$

What is the proof that the alcohol has been oxidised?
- Oxygen atom has been added to propanol to form propanoic acid.

What happens if wine is left exposed to air?
- Ethanol in wine is oxidised by aerobic bacteria, forming ethanoic acid.
- This process only happens to ethanol

### Dehydration

$$\ce{C_3H_7OH ->[conc.\space H_3PO_4\space catalyst] C_3H_6 + H_2O}$$

#### As a solvent

- Used in paints, varnishes and perfumes.
- Why is alcohol a good solvent?

The structure of alcohol enables interaction with the organic substances which would not have dissolved in water.

The presence of the hydroxyl group allows to form hydrogen bonds readily with other non-organic substances.

#### As a fuel

- Main constituent in methylated spirit (used in spirit lamps and burners)
- In some countries, it is added to petrol and sold as a "blend".

__Which apparatus is the condenser? purpose?__

- To prevent volatile organic reagents from escaping.
- __Any vapour will condense on the cool surface of the condenser and flow back into the flask.__

![Experimental Setup](./11_3_Alcohols_and_Carboxylic_Acids/figure1.png)

### Hydrolysis of Esters

- Esters can be __hydrolysed__ (broken down by water) to form original carboxylic acid and alcohol
- Warm with dilute acid

1. Look out for the $\ce{C-O}$ bond in the functional group of ester
$$\ce{C_2H_5-CO-||-O-CH_3}$$
    - methyl propanoate
2. Separate out the molecule
$$\ce{C_2H_5COO + O-CH_3}$$
3. Add $\ce{-O-H}$ to the $\ce{C=O}$, to form an acid. Add $\ce{-O-H}$ to the remaining part of the compound to form an alcohol.
$$\ce{C_2H_5COOH + H-O-CH_3}$$
    - propanoic acid + methanol

> [!NOTE]
> __Why does the use of dilute acid favour the reverse reaction?__
>
> Hint: What product is formed in the forward reaction?
>
> The presence of water shifts the equilibrium to the left, hence a dilute acid solution would favour the reverse reaction.
