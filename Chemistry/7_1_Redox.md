| Hydrogen         | Loss of hydrogen            | Gain of hydrogen            |
| Electrons        | Loss of electrons           | Gain of electrons           |
| Oxidation States | Increase in Oxidation State | Decrease in Oxidation State |

## Transfer of Electrons - Definition

In the following redox reaction, __zinc metal is oxidised while copper(II) ions are reduced.__

Consider the following reaction:

$$\ce{Zn(s) + CuCl_2(aq) -> ZnCl_2 (aq) + Cu(s)}$$

Ionic equation:

$$\ce{Zn(s) + Cu^{2+} (aq) -> Zn^{2+} (aq) + Cu(s)}$$

An ionic half equation shows which reactant particles gain or lose electrons to form products. To construct ionic half equations, follow these steps:

1. __Isolate reactant and product of the same element__ into a single ionic half equation.
2. __Add coefficients__ to balance the number of elements on the reactant and product sides of the ionic half equation
3. __Add electrons__ to the ionic half equations to balance the charges on the reactant and product sides. Note that electrons are negatively charged.
4. __Write state symbols__ for all reactant and product particles.

Oxidation ionic half equation involving zinc:

$$\ce{Zn(s) -> Zn^{2+} (aq) + 2e^-}$$

Reduction ionic half equation involving copper:

$$\ce{Cu^{2+} + 2e^- -> Cu(s)}$$

| Reactant Particle | Is reactant particle oxidised/reduced? | Are electrons on reactant or product side? | Did reactant particle undergo gain or loss of electrons? |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| $\ce{Zn}$         | Oxidised                               | product                                    | loss                                                     |
| $\ce{Cu^{2+}}$    | Reduced                                | reactant                                   | gain                                                     |

#### Using ideas about electron transfer, explain why the reaction between zinc metal and aqueous copper(II) chloride is a redox reaction.
    
- Zinc atom loses electrons to form $\ce{Zn^{2+}}$ ions and copper(II) ions gained electrons to form copper atoms. Hence, zinc atom is oxidised and copper(II) ions are reduced simultaneously.

#### Based on the definitions of oxidation and reduction written in (iii), deduce if oxidation and reduction can take place independently of one another. Explain your answer.

- Oxidation and reduction cannot take place independently of one another as electrons that are lost by a particle is gained by another particle.

#### From your answer in (v), briefly define a redox reaction.

- A redox reaction is a chemical reaction in which reduction and oxidation occur at the same time.

### Examples

_By constructing ionic and ionic half equations for the following reactions, use ideas about electron transfer to explain why they are redox reactions._

$$\ce{2HCl(aq) + Mg(s) -> MgCl_2(aq) + H_2(g)}$$

Ionic equation: $\ce{2H^+(aq) + Mg(s) -> Mg^{2+}(aq) + H_2(g)}$

Ionic half equations:

Oxidation: $\ce{Mg(s) -> Mg^{2+} (aq) + 2e^-}$

Reduction: $\ce{2H^+(aq) + 2e^- -> H_2(g)}$
