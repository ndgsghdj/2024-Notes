# Kinetic Particle Theory

## What is Kinetic Particle Theory?

Matter is defined as any substance that has __mass__ and __volume__.

### Kinetic Particle Theory

The __kinetic particle theory__ states that:
- All matter is composed of __tiny particles__
- that are in __a constant state of motion (have kinetic energy.)__

### Properties

| Properties                             | Solid                                          | Liquid                                                                                         | Gases                                           |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Forces of Attraction between particles | __Strong attractive forces__ between particles | __Relatively strong attractive forces__ between particles BUT weaker than those in solid. | __Weak forces of attraction between particles__ |
| Arrangement of Particles | Particles are __orderly arranged__ in a fixed position. Hence, they have a __fixed shape__. It has a __fixed volume as a solid cannot be compressed__ since its particles are already very close to one another with very little space between the particles. | Particles are __NOT held in fixed positions__. They are arranged in a disorderly manner. Hence, they __DO NOT have a fixed shape__. Particles of a liquid are farther away from one another than a
solid. However, they are __still packed quite closely together.__ Hence, a liquid __cannot be compressed and has a fixed volume.__ | Particles are __NOT held in fixed positions.__ Particles are __spread far apart from one another.__ Hence, they __DO NOT have a fixed shape.__ |
| Movement of Particles | Particles are __unable to move freely__.        | Particles are __able to move freely and slide across one another.__                                  | Particles __move rapidly in high speeds in any direction__. |
| Energy of Particles   | Particles __vibrate about its fixed positions__ | Particles of a liquid have __more kinetic energy than__ particles of a solid in the same substance. | Particles have high kinetic energy.                         |

## Changes in Temperature

### Heating and Cooling of Particles

| Heating/Cooling | Change in __distance__ between particles                                                                                       | Change in __movement__ of particles   | Change in __arrangement__ of particles                                                                                              |
| -               | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heating         | Distance between particles increases and particles are further apart from one another                                      | Vibrates faster and more vigorously   | From sliding over one another within the liquid to free to move anywhere in the container                                        |
| Cooling         | Distance between particles decreases and particles get closer.                                              | Vibrates slower and less vigorously   | From sliding over one another witin the liquid to vibrating at fixed positions                                                  |

### Heating Curve

| Solid and Liquid         | Constant                                                | Particles continue to vibrate, without increase in kinetic energy                            | Particles are starting to slide over one another      | Energy is taken in to overcome the forces of attraction between particles                |

## Brownian Motion

The __kinetic model of matter__ states that all matter is made up of a large number of small particles (e.g. atoms, molecules, ions) which are in __continuous and random motion.__

### Definition of Diffusion

Diffusion is the __movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.__

### Factors affecting the rate of diffusion

#### Temperature

- As temperature increases, the particles __move faster and spread through water more quickly.__
- The __higher the temperature__, the __faster the rate of diffusion__.

#### Relative Molecular Mass

> Since __ammonia particles have a smaller relative molecular mass,__ they __move faster than hydrogen chloride particles__. The ammonia particles __move further along the tube than the hydrogen chloride particles__ before the particles collide and react to form ammonium chloride

- The __greater the relative molecular mass of the molecule__, the __slower the rate of diffusion__

#### Concentration

- The greater number of $\ce{CO}$ molecules means that there is a __higher statistical probability that the $\ce{CO}$ molecules will spread through the solution, increasing the diffusion rate.__

## Essential Questions

> How does energy affect the arrangement and behaviour of the particles in matter?

- When __particles absorb energy in the form of heat, they move more quickly due to an increase in kinetic energy.__
- At temperatures when the substance is changing state, the __energy gained is used to overcome forces of attraction__, and the __particles spread further apart and move more freely__, resulting in a more random arrangement.
