## Cation Test

### First Method: Addition of Sodium Hydroxide

#### Experimental procedure:

1. Add 2-3 drops of sodium hydroxide to the given solution and shake gently. Note observations.
2. Continue adding sodium hydroxide to the mixture and shake gently. Note down your observations upon addition of excess sodium hydroxide to the mixture.

#### Observation

- Precipitate formed?
- Colour of precipitate?

If precipitate is formed, proceed to the next step. 

- Shake and observe carefully to see if the precipitate

| Sample Solution    | Cations Present    | Chemical Formulae of Products     |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Ammonium nitrate | $\ce{NH^+_4}$ ion |  $\ce{NH_3 (g) + H_2O(l) + NaNO_3 (aq)}$ |

### Dissociation Equation for Aqueous Ammonia

$$\ce{NH_3 (aq) + H_2O (l) -> NH_4^+ (aq) + OH^- (aq)}$$

As aqueous ammonia dissociates to form ammonium cations and hydroxide anions, the hydroxide anions are able to react with the metal cations to form the insoluble hydroxides which will appear in the form of precipitates.

## Second Method: Addition of Aqueous Ammonia

### Experimental Procedure

1. Add 2-3 drops of aqueous ammonia to the given solution and shake gently. Note down the observations.
2. Continue adding aqueous ammonia to the mixture and shake gently. Note down your observations upon addition of excess sodium hydroxide to the mixture.

### Why do we need 2 reagents?

#### What are the observations for addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide and aqueous ammonia to calcium nitrate?

- __Observations for addition of sodium hydroxide:__ White precipitate forms upon addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide. When excess aqueous sodium hydroxide is added, the white precipitate does not dissolve.
- __Observations for addition of aqueous ammonia:__ No precipitate forms upon addition of aqueous ammonia.

#### Why is there such a difference in observation for addition of sodium hydroxide and aqueous ammonia?

- The white precipitate formed in the addition of sodium hydroxide is calcium hydroxide, $\ce{Ca(OH)_2}$. According to the solubility table, calcium hydroxide is partially soluble in water.
- As sodium hydroxide is a strong alkali while aqueous ammonia is a weak alkali, the concentration of $\ce{OH^-}$ ions present in the solution differs.
- Hence, the concentration of calcium hydroxide when aqueous ammonia is added is lower than that of when aqueous sodium hydroxide is added.
- At lower concentrations, the solid structure of calcium hydroxide does not become a visible size. 
- Therefore, we are not able to see the formation of the precipitate.Header name

### Purpose of Adding Nitric Acid

- There may be impurities present: i.e. hydroxide and carbonate ions that can precipitate with the same test reagents and give misleading positive results. 
    * Most carbonates and hydroxides are __insoluble.__
- Thus, nitric acid is added to acidify the test sample, so as to __react away any possible carbonates and hydroxides__ in the test sample.
- These carbonates and hydroxides (if present) can also precipitate with the same test reagent and give false positive results.

## Testing for Water

- Copper (II) sulfate has two different forms. One is anhydrous and one is hydrated.
- The anhydrous copper(II) sulfate is a white powdery solid while hydrated copper(II) sulfate is a blue crystalline solid.
