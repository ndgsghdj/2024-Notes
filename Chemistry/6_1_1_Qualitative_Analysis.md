## Cation Test

### First Method: Addition of Sodium Hydroxide

#### Experimental procedure:

1. Add 2-3 drops of sodium hydroxide to the given solution and shake gently. Note observations.
2. Continue adding sodium hydroxide to the mixture and shake gently. Note down your observations upon addition of excess sodium hydroxide to the mixture.

#### Observation

- Precipitate formed?
- Colour of precipitate?

If precipitate is formed, proceed to the next step. 

- Shake and observe carefully to see if the precipitate

### Test for Cations - Table

__Experimental Procedure:__ Add 2-3 drops of aqueous sodium hydroxide to the solution
__Type of Reaction:__ Precipitation

__Experimental Procedure:__ Add equal volumes of sodium hydroxide and test sample in the test tube and warm.
__Type of Reaction:__ Base + Ammonium salt

| Sample Solution    | Cations Present    | Chemical Formulae of Products     |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Ammonium nitrate | $\ce{NH^+_4}$ ion |  $\ce{NH_3 (g) + H_2O(l) + NaNO_3 (aq)}$ |

### Dissociation Equation for Aqueous Ammonia

$$\ce{NH_3 (aq) + H_2O (l) -> NH_4^+ (aq) + OH^- (aq)}$$

As aqueous ammonia dissociates to form ammonium cations and hydroxide anions, the hydroxide anions are able to react with the metal cations to form the insoluble hydroxides which will appear in the form of precipitates.

## Second Method: Addition of Aqueous Ammonia

### Experimental Procedure

1. Add 2-3 drops of aqueous ammonia to the given solution and shake gently. Note down the observations.
2. Continue adding aqueous ammonia to the mixture and shake gently. Note down your observations upon addition of excess sodium hydroxide to the mixture.
