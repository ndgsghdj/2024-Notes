## Humidity

Humidity is the measurement of water vapour content in air and the water vapour content in air varies.

### Suggest a possible reason why the water vapour content in air varies

Humidity is affected by __temperature__ and __pressure__.

__Location__ can also affect the humidity. In the desert, it is likely that there will be less water vapour present as compared to the coastal areas.

## Separation of Air

How can air be separated to obtain the various constituent gases?

| Type of Gas    | Composition by Volume | Boiling Point / Â°C |
|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Nitrogen       | 78%                   | -196.0             |
| Oxygen         | 21%                   | -183.0             |
| Argon          | 0.93%                 | -185.0             |
| Carbon dioxide | 0.04%                 | -78.5              |

Based on the table, each gas has its own boiling point and __through fractional distillation of liquefied air,__ it is possible to obtain each individual gas.

- In the Haber Process, the nitrogen used in the manufacture of ammonia is obtained through distillation of liquefied air.
- However, this is not encouraged for gases aside from nitrogen.
    * That is due to the fact that attempting to obtain any gas aside from nitrogen from liquefied air gives a low yield as the composition of gases in air shows that majority of air is made up of nitrogen.

## Types of Air Pollutants

### Air pollutants, their sources, and effects

#### Carbon Monoxide, $\ce{CO}$

##### Source of Pollutant

- __Incomplete combustion__ of carbon-containing fuels
- Examples of sources:
    * Vehicles and industrial plants
    * Forest fire

##### Effects of Pollutant

- Colourless, odourless __toxic__ gas that __reduces the ability of haemoglobin in blood to transport oxygen to the rest of the body.__ (due to formation of carboxyhaemoglobin)
- Leads to __breathing difficulties, headaches, fatigue before death.__

##### Ways to Reduce Pollutant

- __Catalytic converters__ to convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide
- __Reduce__ the use of carbon-containing fuels

##### Relevant Chemical Equations

__Chemical equations in catalytic converters:__

- $\ce{2CO (g) + O_2 (g) -> 2CO_2 (g)}$

#### Oxides of Nitrogen - $\ce{NO, NO2}$

##### Source of Pollutant

- $\ce{N_2}$ and $\ce{O_2}$ in the air reacts at __high temperatures__ to form $\ce{NO}$.
- $\ce{NO}$ then further reacts with $\ce{O_2}$ to form $\ce{NO_2}$.

__Examples:__
- Combustion engine of vehicles
- Forest fire
- Lightning

##### Effects of Pollutant

__Impact on Health__
- Irritates eyes and lungs, causing breathing difficulties

##### Effects on Environment

- Forms __acid rain__ which __corrodes buildings and harms plants and aquatic life (Give the impacts!)__

##### Ways to Reduce Pollutant

- __Catalytic Converters__ to convert nitrogen monoxide to nitrogen

##### Relevant Chemical Equations

__How are oxides of nitrogen produced?__

1. $\ce{N_2 (g) + O_2 (g) -> 2NO(g)}$
2. $\ce{2NO (g) + O_2(g) -> 2NO_2 (g)}$

__How is acid rain formed?__

$$\ce{4NO_2 (g) + 2H_2O (l) -> 4HNO_3(aq)}$$

__How does catalytic converter reduce oxides of nitrogen?__

$$\ce{2NO (g) + 2CO (g) -> 2CO_2 (g) + N_2 (g)}$$

#### Sulfur Dioxide - $\ce{SO_2}$

##### Source of Pollutant

- Combustion of fossil fuel such as coal, petroleum

__Examples of Sources:__
- Power stations
- Volcanic eruption

##### Effects of Pollutant

__Impact on Health__

- Irritates eyes and lungs, causing breathing difficulties

__Impact on Environment__

- Forms __acid rain__ which corrodes buildings and harms plants and aquatic life.

##### Ways to Reduce Pollutant

- Expensive method:
    * Remove fossil fuels before they are burnt
- Cheaper method:
    * Flue gas desulfurisation

##### Relevant Chemical Equations

__How is sulfur dioxide produced?__

$$\ce{S(s) + O_2 (g) -> SO_2 (g)}$$

__How is acid rain formed?__

1. $\ce{2SO_2 (g) + 2H_2O (l) -> 2H_2SO_4 (aq)}
2. __or__ $\ce{SO_2 + H_2O -> H_2SO_3}$
3. $\ce{2H_2SO_3 + O_2 -> 2H_2SO_4}$

__How does flue gas desulfurisation work?__

- $\ce{CaCO_3(s) -> CaO(s) + CO_2(g)}$
- $\ce{CaO(s) + SO_2 (g) -> CaSO_3 (s)}$
- $\ce{2CaSO_3 (s) + O_2 (g) -> 2CaSO_4 (s)}$

#### Unburnt Hydrocarbons (e.g. octane)

##### Source of Pollutant

- Incomplete combustion of fuels in vehicle engine

##### Effects of Pollutant

__Impact on Health__
- Cancer causing (carcinogenic)
- Reacts with sunlight and other pollutants to form ozone.

##### Ways to Reduce Pollutant

- __Catalytic converters__ to convert unburnt hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water
- Use of cleaner fuels such as hydrogen

##### Relevant Chemical Equations

__How do catalytic converters reduce unburnt hydrocarbons?__

$$\ce{2C_8H_{18} (l) + 25O_2 (g) -> 16CO_2 (g) + 18H_2O (g)}$$

### Effects of Acid Rain

#### Ground level ozone, $\ce{O_3}$

##### Source of Pollutant

- Forms when __unburnt hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides__ react in the presence of sunlight

##### Effects of Pollutant

__Impact on health__
- Creates __photochemical smog__ (a mixture of ozone, unburnt hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides) which __irritates eyes and lungs, causing breathing difficulties__

__Impact on environment__
- damages crops

##### Ways to Reduce Pollutant

*see methods of reducing unburnt hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides as they react to produce ground level ozone.*

### Ozone Layer

#### Ozone and its Importance

- Ozone is an important part of the stratosphere
- Acts as shield, __filtering out some of the harmful ultraviolet radiation__, *reducing the chances of getting skin cancer, genetic mutations and eye damage.*

#### How is Ozone Similar to Oxygen?

- Ozone is an allotrope of oxygen, formed out of 3 oxygen atoms.

#### Important Fact

- In small concentrations, ozone is non-toxic
- However, in high concentrations (100 ppm), __ozone becomes toxic__
- Too much ozone can damage the tissues of the respiratory tract.

#### Chlorofluorocarbons

- Chlorofluorocarbons are examples of ozone-depleting substances (ODS)
- Also known as CFCs, they are compounds that contain the elements carbon, fluorine, and chlorine.
- __CFCs are generally used in the manufacture of aerosol sprays, blowing agents for foams and packing materials, as solvents, and as refrigerants.__

##### Role of CFCs

CFCs in the atmosphere are decomposed by sunlight to produce chlorine radicals. These chlorine radicals then react with ozone molecules and destroy them by converting them into oxygen molecules.

1. $\ce{CFCl_3 ->[UV light] CFCl_2^+ + Cl^-}$
2. $\ce{Cl^- + O_3 -> ClO^- + O_2}$
3. $\ce{ClO^- + O^- -> O_2 + Cl^-}$

### Carbon Cycle

- Describes the process in which carbon atoms continually travel from the atmosphere to the Earth and then back into the atmosphere.
- This cycle is important for maintaining a stable climate and carbon balance on Earth.
- Carbon dioxide is __0.03%__ of atmosphere content by volume
- This represents a huge reservoir of carbon, which is constantly being removed from and returned to the atmosphere by a variety of processes.

| Process that takes in carbon from the atmosphere | Process which gives out carbon to the atmosphere |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Photosynthesis by plants                         | Respiration by animals                           |
| Ocean uptake                                     | Respiration by plants                            |
|                                                  | Combustion of carbon-containing fuels            |
|                                                  | Bacterial decomposition of organic matter        |
