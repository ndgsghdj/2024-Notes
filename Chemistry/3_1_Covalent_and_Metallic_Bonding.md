# Covalent and Metallic Bonding

## Structure and Bonding of Covalent Substances

Covalent substances can exist as:
- Simple covalent molecules
- Giant covalent molecules

## Simple Covalent Molecules

### How are oxygen molecules represented in all states? Why?

- There are __very strong electrostatic forces of attraction__ between the shared pair of electrons and the positively charged nuclei of the __atoms__ sharing the electrons, which is also known as a __covalent bond.__

### How is the arrangement of the molecules different in each state?

- The forces of attraction between the molecules are __weak__
- These forces are known as __intermolecular forces of attraction__

#### During State Change

- __Intermolecular forces of attraction are weakened__ as the state changes. Hence, oxygen molecules are not held closely together anymore.
- Covalent bonds are intact, hence oxygen atoms are still bonded together

## Giant Covalent Molecules

### Giant Covalent Molecules

1. Diamond
2. Graphite
3. Silicon Dioxide  

### Allotropes

- __Allotropes__ are physical forms of the __same chemical element__ in which the __atoms are bonded together in different arrangements__

### Description of Structure and Bonding

| Name of Substance | Type of Structure |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Diamond | Giant molecular structure |

#### Description of Structure of Diamond

- Each carbon atom uses all its __4 valence electrons__ to form 4 covalent bonds with __4 other carbon atoms__ to form a __tetrahydral structure.__ Diamond exists as a __giant molecular structure.__

#### Description of Structure of Graphite

- Each carbon atom uses __3 valence electrons__ to form 3 covalent bonds with __3 other carbon atoms__ to form __hexagonal layers__ of carbon atoms with __weak intermolecular forces of attraction between layers.__
- __Fourth valence electron is delocalised__ between layers of carbon atoms.
