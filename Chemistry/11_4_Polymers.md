# Polymers

## Macromolecules

- Macromolecules are made from smaller subunits, such as:
    * Polymers
        + Smaller subunits are the same type of molecules
    * Non-Polymers

## Polymers and Repeating Units

- Polymers are made from many __smaller molecules__ called __monomers__
- Each small unit within the polymer that repeats itself is a __repeating unit__

## Addition Polymerisation of Ethene

### Chemical Equation

$$\ce{nC_2H_4 -> (-C_2H_4-)_n}$$

### Conditions

- High temperature and pressure

### Uses

Plastic bags, cling film, plastic containers.

## Condensation Polymerisation

Condensation polymerisation occurs when two monomers with __different functional groups__ combine to form a polymer, with the __removal of a small molecule such as water.__

- One monomer that contains the two carboxylic acid functional groups $\ce{(-COOH)}$, __dicarboxylic acid__
- Another monomer that contains either two alcohol functional groups $\ce{(-OH)}$, __diol__, or two amine functional groups $\ce{-NH_2}$, __diamine__

## Condensation Polymers

### Polyester

- Monomers are linked together by ester linkage

### Polyamide

- Monomers are linked together by amide linkage.

### Condensation Polymer - Polyester (Terylene)

Polyester is formed when a diol and a carboxylic acid undergo condensation polymerisation.

# Polymers - The 'Aftermath' of Plastics

## Characteristics of Plastics

- Relatively cheap
- Easily moulded into various shapes
- Light, tough and waterproof
- Durable (resistant to decay, rusting and chemical attack)

## Problems Caused by Plastics

### Environmental Problems

#### Water Pollution

- Plastics in the sea __endanger marine animals,__ often __mistaken for food__ and harmed by them.
- Plastics also __clog up rivers and drains,__ becoming breeding grounds for mosquitoes, spreading diseases like __dengue__.

#### Air Pollution

- Plastics are mostly flammable. When incinerated, plastics __produce poisonous and greenhouse gases.__

## Recycling of Plastics

### Physical Method

#### Pre-treatment of Plastic Waste

- Sort by different methods (manual/density sorting)
- Wash to remove contaminants
- Shredding or grinding to smaller pieces.

#### Mechanical Recycling

- After pre-treatment, small pieces of plastics such as poly(ethene), PE, are melted, cooled, pulled into long, thin strands, and cut into pellets.

### Chemical Method

#### Cracking

- Plastic waste can undergo cracking to form __short chains of alkanes and alkenes__
- Either thermal cracking or catalytic cracking can be done to obtain such products.
    * Short-chain alkanes can be used as fuels
    * Short-chain alkenes may be used to make other useful chemicals through polymerisation.

#### Deploymerisation

- A process in which polymers are broken down into their monomers

##### Acid Hydrolysis

Polyesters can be __hydrolysed__ (broken down by water) to form the original monomers. This is done by __warming__ the polyester with an acid catalyst.
