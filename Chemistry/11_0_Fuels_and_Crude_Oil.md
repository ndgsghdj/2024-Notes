# Fuels and Crude Oil

> _Editor's note: wtf is this topic_

## Fractionating Column

![figure1](Fuels_Crude_Oil/figure1.png)

Mixture of crude oil is heated so that __it enters the fractionating column as a *gaseous mixture*__ &rarr; ALL the fractions exist as vapour at the same time and then __separate out by selectively condensing__

__Note:__ During fractional distillation the liquids __DO NOT 'boil' or 'evaporate' one at a time__

> State the relationship between the position of the fractions collected and their respective boiling points.

## Difference between bioresources and biofuels

Bioresources are raw materials from human or animal activity that are renewable and biodegradable, however, biofuels are fuels that may be derived from bioresources, to be used as alternatives to conventional fossil fuels.

## Government's Plan to Support Domestic Power Generation

It's plan is to blend the use of biomethane in larger quantities with natural gas in the piped networks to support domestic power generation.

## Three Factors for Consideration before Extensive Implementation of Use of Biofuels in Singapore.

- Cost effectiveness in emissions reduction
- Existing infrastructure for fuels and feedstocks
- Suitability of applications for deployment by 2050.

## Suggest one negative impact of the use of biofuel and bioresources on the biodiversity, land use and carbon cycle.

- Biodiversity : With the need for biofuel, there might be a tendency to increase the production of certain types of crops. This will lead to the loss of biodiversity and possible disruption in the natural eco-systems.
- Land use: With the demand for biofuel, there might be demand for land use to grow such crops to meet the demand. There will be competing uses for the land such as for agricultural needs to support food compared to the fuel industry.
- Carbon cycle: Deforestation and land conversion programmes to clear and prepare the lands required to produce biofuel, may release significant amount of CO2. This can offset the environmental sustainability factor of biofuels of being carbon-neutral.

## Possible Contribution of Singapore in Future of Biofuel

Singapore could possibly be a leader in the importing of biofuels and refining them for export.

## Biofuels

- Biofuels are alternative renewable energy sources to crude oil and natural gas.
    * Biofuels are a renewable energy source that is derived from plant, algal or animal biomass.

## Carbon-Intensive Sectors

- Electricity generation
- Transport industry
- Heavy industry
    * Types of businesses that carry a high capital cost, high barriers to entry and low transportability, e.g. petrochemical industry, oil refining, aerospace and aviation.
