# Introduction to Organic Chemistry

## Organic Compounds

Elements that most organic compounds contain:
- All organic compounds contain __carbon__.
- Most also contain hydrogen
- Others may contain elements such as oxygen, nitrogen or a halogen.

### Homologous Series

- A homologous series is a family of compounds with the __same general formula and similar chemical properties.__
- Each homologous series has a general formula.
	- Subsequent members of organic compounds in the same homologous series differ by a chemical formula of $\ce{-CH_2}$

### Functional Group

- A functional group is a group of atoms that are bonded together in a way that is unique to that particular homologous series. The functional group is responsible for a compound's characteristic __chemical properties__.
- As they possess the same functional group, members of the same homologous series will __react in a similar way to one another.__

## Alkanes and Alkenes

### Properties

|                           | Alkane                                                                                                   | Alkene                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Saturated or Unsaturated? | Saturated hydrocarbon. An alkane contains only single covalent bonds between carbon atoms, $\ce{C-C}$. | Unsaturated hydrocarbon. An alkene contains a double covalent bond between carbon atoms, $\ce{C=C}$ |
| General Formula           | $\ce{C_nH_{2n + 2}}$                                                                                     | $\ce{C_nH_{2n+2}}$                                                                                      |

### Using Prefixes to Name Organic Compounds

| Prefix | Number of Carbon | Name of Alkane | Name of Alkene |
|--------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| meth-  | 1                | methane        | -              |
| eth-   | 2                | ethane         | ethene         |
| prop-  | 3                | propane        | propene        |
| but-   | 4                | butane         | butene         |
| pent-  | 5                | pentane        | pentene        |

### Properties

- E.g: Boiling point, Melting point, Electrical conductivity (physical properties).
- For Organic Chemistry: __Viscosity (physical)__ and __Flammability (Chemical)__

#### Viscosity

- Measure of "thickness" and stickiness of a liquid
- Ability of fluid to flow

#### Flammability

- __Chemical property:__ The ability of a chemical to burn or ignite, causing fire or combustion.
- Can compare flashpoints: GENERALLY - __higher flashpoint, lower flammability.__

### Trends: MP and BP (physical)

#### Trend and Explanation

The melting points and boiling points of the alkanes generally increases as *relative molecular mass* increases.
- Larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces of attraction.
- More energy is required to overcome the stronger intermolecular forces of attraction.
- higher MP and BP.

### Trends: Flammability (chemical)

#### Trend and Explanation

The flashpoints of the alkanes and alkenes generally increases as *relative molecular mass increases* &rarr; *flammability* decreases.
- larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces of attraction, thus less volatile (likelihood of existing as a gas)
- larger molecules also have higher percentage of carbon &rarr; requires more oxygen to burn &rarr; less flammable.

### Trends: Viscosity (Physical)

#### Trend and Explanation

As relative molecular mass increases, the liquid alkanes and alkenes have *higher viscosity.*
- larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces of attraction.
- harder for liquid containing larger molecules to flow.

### Summary

The gradual change in properties can be observed in __all__ homologous series as a result of the *increase in molecular mass of molecules down the homologous series*.

## Isomerism

### Definition

Isomerism is the phenomenon where __compounds (isomers) have the same molecular formula but different structural formulae.__

- Do not have to be of the same homologous series.
- Different homologous series can have the __same molecular formula.__
