# Periodic Table

## Group 1 Elements

- Elements of Group 1 of the Periodic Table are also known as __alkali metals.__
### Properties

1. Group 1 metals have __lower__ density than other metals
2. Densities of Group 1 metals __increase__ down the group
3. Group 1 metals have __lower__ melting points compared to other metals.
4. Melting points of Group 1 metals __decrease__ down the group
5. Group 1 metals can be cut by a knife and are __softer__ compared to other metals.

### Chemical Properties

1. Group 1 metals react in presence of __water (moisture from air)__
2. Group 1 metals react with water to form metal hydroxides and hydrogen gas.
3. The reactivity of Group 1 metals increase down the group.
    - Down the group, the number of electron shells increase, resulting in an __increase in the size of atoms.__ The valence electron will be __located further from the positively charged nucleus.__ Less energy is absorbed to overcome the __weaker electrostatic forces of attraction.__

## Group 17 Elements

Elements in Group 17 of the Periodic Table are also known as __halogens__

### Properties

1. Group 17 elements exist as __diatomic__ molecules.
2. The colour of Group 17 elements gets __more intense__ down the group.
3. Boiling points of Group 17 elements __increase__ down the group.
    - Down the group, there is an __increase in the atomic radius of the elements__ due to the increase in number of electron shells.
    - With a larger atomic radius, the __intermolecular forces of attraction between molecules increases.__
    - Hence __more energy__ is __absorbed__ to overcome the stronger intermolecular forces between halogen molecules.

### Chemical Properties

1. Halogens react __violently__ with __reactive__ metals to form a __salt__
    - $\ce{2Na (s) + Cl_2 (g) -> 2NaCl(s)}$
2. __Halogen displacement according to reactivity__
3. Halogens react to gain electrons and form __anions__
4. The reactivity of halogens decreases down Group 17
