<h1 id="computer-network">Computer Network</h1>
<p>A computer network is a system of two or more computers (or devices)
that are connected together by a transmission medium for the exchange of
data.</p>
<h1 id="advantages">Advantages</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Resources</strong>
<ul>
<li>A network allows a group of computers to make use of shared
resources such as printers or files</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shared Internet Access</strong>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the network’s configuration, every user who logs on to
the network may have access to the internet</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shared software: Software</strong>
<ul>
<li>Can be stored on the central server of a network and deployed to
other computers over a network</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shared Storage</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data files can be stored on a central server for ease of access and
backup purposes</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>
<ul>
<li>Computers in the same network are often able to share instant
messages and emails for communication</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h1>
<ul>
<li>Initial Costs
<ul>
<li>Installing a network could be costly due to the high setup and
equipment costs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maintenance Costs
<ul>
<li>There are also subsequent costs associated with administering and
maintaining the network</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Security Risks
<ul>
<li>As files are shared through a network, there is the risk of virus or
worm attacks spreading throughout the network even with just one
infected computer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Risk of data loss
<ul>
<li>Data may just become lost due to hardware failures or errors. Using
a network means regular data backups are needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Server outage
<ul>
<li>If the server fails, the network will not be able to function, thus
affecting work processes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="types-of-computer-networks">Types of Computer Networks</h1>
<h2 id="geographical-location">Geographical Location</h2>
<ul>
<li>Local Area Network (LAN) - Network of connecting devices connected
within a small geographical area, typically within the same building,
such as a home, school or office.</li>
<li>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) - Network of computing devices
typically spanning across two or more buildings within the same</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="network-protocols">Network Protocols</h1>
<p>Set of standards and rules that govern how two or more devices
communicate over a network.<br />
OSI stands for <strong>Open Systems Interconnection</strong>. The OSI
model is a conceptual model created by the International Organisation
for Standardisation which enables diverse communication to communicate
using standard protocols.<br />
The OSI model does not perform any functions in the networking process.
It divides network communication into seven layers. The OSI Model can be
seen as a universal language for computer networking. It is based on the
concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract
layers, each one stacked upon the last.</p>
<p><strong>Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)</strong>. In this model,
layers 1-4 are considered the lower layers and mostly concern themselves
\</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>All People Seem To Need Data Processing</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="osi-physical-layer">OSI Physical Layer</h1>
<p>The lowest layer of the OSI Model is concerned with electrically or
optically transmitting raw unstructured data bits across the network
from the physical layer of the sending device to the physical layer of
the receiving device. It can include specifications</p>
<h1 id="osi-data-link-layer">OSI Data Link Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Physical Addressing</strong><br />
At the data link layer, directly connected nodes are used to perform
node-to-node data transfer where data is packaged into frames. The data
link layer also corrects errors that may have occurred at the physical
layer.<br />
The data link layer encompasses two sub-layers of its own. The first
media access control (MAC), provides flow control</p>
<p><strong>Path Determination and Logical Addressing</strong> The
network layer is repsonsible for receiving frames from the data link
layer, and delivering them to their intended destinations among based on
the addresses contained inside the frame. The network layer finds the
destination</p>
<h1 id="osi-transport-layer">OSI Transport Layer</h1>
<p><strong>End to End Connection and Reliability</strong><br />
The transport layer manages the delivery and error checking of data
packets. It regulates the size, sequencing, and ultimately the transfer
of data<br />
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol; also known as
the internet protocol suite) is the set of protocols used over the
internet. It organises how data packets are communicated and make sure
packets have the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source - which computer the message came from.</li>
<li>Destination - where the message should go</li>
<li>Packet Seqeuence - The order the message data should be
re-assembled</li>
<li>Data - the data of the message</li>
<li>Error Check - The check to see that the message has been sent
correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="osi-session-layer">OSI Session Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Interhost Communication</strong> The session layer controls
the conversations betyween different computers. A session or connection
between machines is set up, managed and terminated at layer 5. Session
layer services also include authentication and reconnections. E.g.
Session establishment in TCP, SIP, RTP.</p>
<h1 id="osi-presentation-layer">OSI Presentation Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Data Representation and Communication</strong><br />
The presentation layer formats or translates data for the application
layer based on the syntax or semantics that the application accepts.
Because of this, it is also at times is also called the syntax layer.
This layer can also handle the encryption and decryption required by the
application layer. E.g. HTML, DOC, JPEG, MP3, M4V, Sockets</p>
<h1 id="osi-application-layer">OSI Application Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Network process to Application</strong><br />
At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact
directly with the software application. This layer sees network services
provided to end-user applications such as a web browser or Office 365.
The application layer identifies communication partners, resources
availability and synchronises communication. E.g. DNS, WWW/HTTP, P2P,
EMAIL/POP, SMTO, Telnet FTP.</p>
<p>TCP/IP Protocol includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP - transfers web pages from web servers to the client. All web
page addresses start with http. An https address is a secure web address
which has been encrypted. An https address is used for sites holding
bank details and secure information.</li>
<li>FTP - used to transfer large files. It is often used for organising
files on a web server for a website. You can have private access to
download the documents that you have shared.</li>
<li>UDP - User Datagram Protocol - Similar to TCP, but because messages
are sent instead of packets - chunks - it is often faster, allowing for
gaming or video calls over the internet.</li>
<li>SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - governs the sending of emails
over a network to a mail server.</li>
<li>IMAP/POP3 - Internet Message Access Protocol - governs retrieving
emails from email servers.</li>
<li>VOIP - is a set of protocols that enables people to have voice
conversations over the internet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tcp">TCP</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slower but more reliable transfers</li>
<li>Typical Applications:
<ul>
<li>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</li>
<li>Web Browsing</li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="udp">UDP</h2>
<ul>
<li>Faster but not guaranteed transfers ("best effort")</li>
<li>Typical Applications:
<ul>
<li>Live streaming</li>
<li>Online games</li>
<li>VoIP</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The reason why FTP uses only TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is
that TCP provides a <strong>reliable</strong>, connection-oriented,
byte-stream service, which is</p>
<p>TCP is slower but more reliable it makes sure the data is safely
passed. UDP on the other hand does not care and yeets the data hoping it
works.</p>
<p>UDP uses time-sensitive transmissions. It speeds up transmissions by
enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the
receiving party. Basically 2fast4u.</p>
<h2 id="arp">ARP</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-arp">What is ARP?</h3>
<p>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol or procedure that
connects an ever-changing Internet Protocol (IP) address to a fixed
physical machine address, also known as a media access control (MAC)
address.</p>
<h1 id="transmission-mediums">Transmission Mediums</h1>
<p>A <strong>wired network</strong> is a network of devices connected by
a physical medium, such as cables. The Ethernet is the most widely used
wired network protocol in LANs and MANs.</p>
<img src="./figure1" />

<p>A <strong>wireless network</strong> is a network of devices in which
signals are transmitted without the use of a physical medium. The most
common wireless network protocol is Wi-Fi, which uses radio waves to
transmit data.</p>
<p>A <strong>Wireless Access Point</strong> (WAP) is a network device
that provides a connection between wireless devices up to 100 metres
away and can connect to wired networks.</p>

operations. E.g. Employees in offices or students in schools would
normally use client computers to do their work.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>server</strong> is a computer that shares resources and
responds to requests from devices and other servers on the network. It
usually has a higher capacity and is more powerful than a client as it
needs to manage resources and services. E.g. Providing central storage
of files, sharing hardware such as printers, controlling logins and
network access.</p></li>

<h3 id="advantages-2">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cheaper to set up as there is no cost related to dedicated
servers</li>
<li>Easy to set up as no specialised or operating system features are
needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages-2">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>More effort is required to access and backup resources as they are
stored locally within each computer instead of centrally in a
server.</li>
<li>Security is an issue as access rights are not administered by a
central server</li>
