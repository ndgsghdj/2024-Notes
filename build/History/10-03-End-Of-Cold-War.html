<h1 id="end-of-the-cold-war">End of the Cold War</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Through the 1950s and 1960s, the Cold War was characterised by a
series of crises and confrontations.</p>
<ul>
<li>In that time, the United States and the USSR never quite took that
fatal step of fighting a direct war with each other.</li>
<li>However, both sides - and indeed the rest of the world - lived in
constant fear of this possibility, especially one that involved nuclear
weapons</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>As a result, by the late 1960s, the two sides were exploring ways
to reduce tensions through <strong>Detente</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They tried to improve relations and even cooperate in areas such as
arms reduction and trade
<ul>
<li>This process became known as detente, a French word that means
"easing of tensions"</li>
<li>The key mover of detente was US President Richard Nixon</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Although relations improved during the detente period, it did not
last because of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too many areas of disagreement between the United States and the
USSR</li>
<li>Too much pressure exerted on both countries</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Internal political rivalries in the United States led several
presidents, especially Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, to adopt tougher
approaches towards the USSR.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rise-and-fall-of-the-detente">Rise and Fall of the Detente</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, US President Richard Nixon and
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev seemed willing to consider the possibility
of having a less hostile relationship.</li>
<li>Both men were concerned about the risk of a direct conflict and the
financial cost of their rivalry.
<ul>
<li>They wanted to invest more in their own economies and the welfare of
their people.</li>
<li>It was this combination of risk and cost which drove detente.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Detente was presented by both sides in a positive thing and as an
act of goodwill
<ul>
<li>However, some historians view detente motivated more by the
superpowers' desire to achieve their aims in less costly and risky
ways.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reasons-for-detente">Reasons for Detente</h3>
<h4 id="leaders-considerations-motivating-detente">Leaders'
considerations motivating detente</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mutual fear of triggering a nuclear war
<ul>
<li>Nixon and Brezhnev were concerned that another crisis like the Cuban
Missile Crisis could trigger a nuclear war.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Soviet fear of being isolated</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Sino-Soviet relations declined throughout the 1960s, while
Sino-American relations improved.
<ul>
<li>Brezhnev was worried that the USSR might become isolated unless he
also improved relations with the United States.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>US desire to withdraw from the Vietnam War
<ul>
<li>Nixon was looking for ways to extract the United States from the
Vietnam War.
<ul>
<li>The United States was struggling with the considerable cost of the
Vietnam War and rising oil prices</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Soviet desire to reduce military spending.
<ul>
<li>Amid its economic problems, the USSR was finding it difficult to
accord its vast military spending in both its domestic and external
commitments.
<ul>
<li>Example: Remaining competitive in the Nuclear Arms Race.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="examples-of-detente-in-action">Examples of Detente in
Action</h4>
<h5 id="summit-meetings">Summit Meetings</h5>
<ul>
<li>They began visiting each other's countries and meeting to discuss
important issues such as nuclear weapons, conflicts around the world,
trade and technology</li>
<li>The meetings were known as <strong>summit meetings</strong>, as they
involved the leaders of the countries.</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 1972</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nixon became the first US President to visit China since it turned
communist in 1949.</li>
<li>A continuation of the progress made in 1971, when the US table
tennis team became the first group of Americans allowed to enter China
since the communist takeover in 1949 (as part of <strong>Ping Pong
Democracy</strong>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>May 1972</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nixon visited Brezhnev in Moscow to sign a document called the Basic
Principles.</li>
<li>The superpowers agreed to prevent dangerous exacerbation in their
relations by doing their utmost to avoid military confrontations, to
prevent the outbreak of nuclear war, and to exercise restraint in mutual
relations.</li>
<li>Both leaders also signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty |
(SALT I), limiting each side's production of nuclear weapons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>June 1973</strong>
<ul>
<li>Brezhnev visited the United States to sign the Agreement on the
Prevention of Nuclear War, in which both sides agreed to do all they
could to avoid a nuclear war.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>June 1974</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nixon went to Moscow again to discuss ways to strengthen
collaboration in many areas, especially in the economic aspects, as well
as for further disarmament and a possible SALT II</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ping-pong-diplomacy">Ping Pong Diplomacy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ping-pong diplomacy refers to the use of table tennis (ping-pong), a
sport that China is good in, to improve relations between the United
States and China.</li>
<li>On 6 April 1971, the United States and Chinese table tennis teams
played against each other at the world championships in Japan.
<ul>
<li>As the Chinese were interested in building better relations with the
United States, they invited the US team to visit China.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On 10 April 1971, the US team became the first Americans to visit
China since the Communist Revolution in 1949.
<ul>
<li>This was widely perceived as an important step in reduc States. It
paved the way for Nixon's visit to China in February 1972 and the
eventual establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States
and China in 1979.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="strategic-arms-limitation-talks-salt">Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks (SALT)</h4>
<ul>
<li>SALT refers to the high-level bilateral conferences and treaties
involving the United States and the USSR in the 1970s.
<ul>
<li>The main concern of these conferences was the limitation of arms in
a bid to reduce tensions and the prospects of a military conflict.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The first round of SALT began in Helsinki, Finland, on 17 November
1969.
<ul>
<li>Considered to be the crowning achievement of the strategy of detente
embarked upon by Nixon and Brezhnev, SALT I saw the United States and
the USSR agree to the limiting of the number of nuclear missiles in
their arsenal. SALT II began in 1974.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It was a complicated and time-consuming process.</li>
<li>In 1979, the SALT Il agreement was missile (for long-range nuclear
attacks) in the 1970s finally announced.
<ul>
<li>By that time, superpower relations had taken a downturn and the US
Congress refused to formally recognise SALT II.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Main Terms of SALT I</strong>
<ul>
<li>Limits on the number of nuclear missiles and bombs held by each
side</li>
<li>Limits on the development of anti-ballistic missile defences, which
could shoot down incoming missiles</li>
<li>Each side was allowed to use spy satellites to verify that the other
side had honoured the limitations imposed</li>
<li>Further talks to be held to create a SALT Il agreement</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Main terms of SALT II</strong>
<ul>
<li>Further limits on the number of bombers and missiles each side
held</li>
<li>Ban on the development and testing of new types of intercontinental
ballistic missiles</li>
<li>Restrictions on the deployment of missiles (e.g. the number of
places they could be launched from)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Helsinki Accords, 1975</strong>
<ul>
<li>US, USSR and 30 other countries signed an agreement in August 1975
where they promised to:
<ul>
<li>Resolve international disputes by diplomacy</li>
<li>Protect human rights e.g. freedom of speech, freedom from unfair
arrest</li>
</ul></li>
