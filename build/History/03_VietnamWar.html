Vietnam War, 1954 - 1975</h1>
<h2 id="vietnam-before-ww2">Vietnam before WW2</h2>
<ul>
<li>The modern state of Vietnam was part of the French-ruled area known
as Indochina
<ul>
<li>It was conquered and controlled by the French Empire progressively
between 1862 and 1904.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As part of French rule…
<ul>
<li>Local forms of government were replaced with French systems of
governance, led by French officials</li>
<li>Western education and healthcare</li>
</ul></li>
<li>French rule was largely characterised by….
<ul>
<li>Resource exploitation</li>
<li>Heavy local taxes</li>
<li>A colonial monopoly on the trade of salt, opium, rice and
alcohol.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thus, there were several attempts to rebel and overthrow French rule
from the 1890s to the 1940s.
<ul>
<li>However, none of them succeeded.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vietnam-during-ww2">Vietnam during WW2</h2>
<ul>
<li>After WWII broke out in Europe in 1939, France was defeated by
Germany a year later in 1940.</li>
<li>Japan, which was an ally of Germany, wanted access to French
Indochina for its resources and strategic position.
<ul>
<li>As a result, Japanese forces invaded the northern region of French
Indochina in September 1940 before coming to an armistice and agreement
with the French Indochina colonial government.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The French colonial government was aligned with Vichy France.
<ul>
<li>Vichy France was the new government set up after the defeat of
France in 1940, and was aligned to Nazi Germany.</li>
<li>Vichy France allowed the Japanese to station troops in
Indochina.</li>
<li>The French colonial government was often reduced to a puppet of the
Japanese during this period.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>French colonial rule and the subsequent Japanese rule in French
Indochina were both harsh.</li>
<li>As a result, various groups emerged to resist French and Japanese
rule.</li>
<li>The most important of these resistance groups was the Viet Minh, led
by Ho Chi Minh.
<ul>
<li>The Viet Minh, short for the League for the Independence of Vietnam
(Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh), was a nationalist movement that aimed to
achieve independence.</li>
<li>It was an umbrella movement made up of two main groups:
<ul>
<li>Non-communists who simply wanted to drive the Japanese out of
Vietnam in favour of self-rule</li>
<li>Communists who wanted to establish an independent communist state in
Vietnam.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>During WWII, the Viet Minh received money, weapons and supplies from
the United States, the USSR and the Guomindang (GMD) government in
China.
<ul>
<li>Even though the GMD government in China was anti-communist, they
supported the Viet Minh against the common enemy that was Japan.</li>
