<h2 id="economic-and-military-strengths-of-the-united-states">Economic
and Military Strengths of the United States</h2>
<p>The Allies won WW2 due to the economic and military strengths of the
United States.</p>
<p>After the attack on Pearl Harbour, the United States' vast resources
were mobilised within a short period of time. Its people, factories,
shipyards, farms and even Hollywood and the movie industry joined in on
the war effort. By 1944, the US was producing almost half of the weapons
being made globally - more than twice of what Japan and Germany were
producing combined. In total, between 1941 and 1945, the US produced
250,000 aircraft, 90,000 tanks, 350 naval destroyers, 200 submarines and
5,600 merchant ships.</p>
<p>This massive production derived from American economic strength
translated into military strength that supplied it and the other Allied
powers with military equipment and resources essential for the war
effort that the Axis powers simply could not match. Hence, this gave
them an overwhelming advantage that allowed them to win the war.</p>
<h2
id="efforts-of-the-united-states-in-the-battle-of-the-atlantic">Efforts
of the United States in the Battle of the Atlantic</h2>
<p>The Allies won WW2 due to the efforts of the United States in the
Battle of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Control of the Atlantic was vital to the Allied war effort as it was
the only way vital American supplies could be shipped to Britain and
USSR. This control was only achieved through bitter struggle and at a
great cost to the Allies. German submarines (U-boats) were very
effective early in the Battle of the Atlantic. In 1940, the Germans sank
over 1,000 British ships, a quarter of Britain's merchant fleet. In
1941, 1,300 Allied ships were lost. In 1942, 1,661 ships. As a result,
in January 1943, the British navy had only two months of oil supply
left.</p>
<p>The tide began to turn in 1943 when British intelligence managed to
break the secret codes used by the U-boats, allowing Allied convoys to
steer clear of the U-boats and deliver the supplies to Britain and the
USSR that could be used to fend off the Axis powers. Weapons and tactics
were developed to counter the U-boats.</p>
<p>This victory allowed the much needed American supplies to reach
Britain and the USSR, allowing them to continue the fight against the
Axis that would ultimately conclude in an Allied victory in WW2.</p>
<h1 id="island-hopping-strategy-in-the-asia-pacific">Island-Hopping
Strategy in the Asia-Pacific</h1>
<p>The Allies won WW2 due to the United States' island-hopping strategy
in the Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>To avoid a potentially lengthy and costly battle against the Japanese
forces which had dug themselves into island strongholds across the vast
empire they had built from 1937-1945, the Allies came up with the
strategy of island-hopping. It involved using air attacks and submarines
to isolate Japanese-held areas, instead of trying to capture them. The
Allies would then conquer the islands, which were poorly defended, and
use them to further cut off ships that supplied the well-defended
islands. The idea was to cut off some areas from their supplies of food,
ammunition and other essentials.</p>
<p>This approach proved to be successful. It allowed the Allies to incur
fewer casualties and come within striking distance of Japan itself
within just a few years. It thus contributed to Allied victory in
WW2.</p>
<h1 id="poor-planning">Poor Planning</h1>
<p>Germany suffered from poor planning in regards to its navy. While the
Germans' use of U-boats was effective, its use of surface ships was less
so. They put too many resources into building giant battleships such as
the Bismarck and Tirpitz, but failed to build aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>These weaknesses in its navy led Germany to defeat in naval battles
such as the Battle of the Atlantic, which meant it was unable to cut off
Britain and the Soviet Union from the vital supply of American resources
shipped across the ocean. This failure ultimately contributed to its
defeat in Ww2.</p>
<p>Germany also suffered from poor planning in regards to its air force.
From 1942 to 1945, the RAF and US Air Force bombed Germany relentlessly.
The Germans never developed heavy bombers such as the RAF's Lancaster or
the US' B-17, which could do severe damage to towns and cities. German
bombers were too small and could not carry enough bombs. Also, in the
Battle of Britain, the RAF had the advantage of radar, which the Germans
had not invested in. The RAF also had plenty of fuel, ammunition and
spare parts. On the other hand, shortages in these resources plagued the
Luftwaffe.</p>
<p>These weaknesses in its air force put it at a major disadvantage
against the Allies that it could not overcome, ultimately contributing
to its defeat in World War 2.</p>
<h1 id="inter-service-rivalry">Inter-Service Rivalry</h1>
<p>The Japanese army and navy had a long-term conflict with each other
since the Meiji period. In the 1930s, both services of the Japanese
military had different strategic goals and ideas for how they wanted to
seize territories to obtain resources to sustain Japan's economy. When
the war broke out, the rivalry between the army and the navy prevented
both groups from sharing resources and exchanging military intelligence,
much less coordinate their attacks and defences against the allies. For
example, in 1942, when the navy asked the army to provide troop support
for an invasion of Australia, the army refused. Furthermore, the army
remained unresponsive throughout the Pacific War and was late to
recognise the threat of the US counteroffensive in late 1942.</p>
<p>This rivalry prevented the Japanese from making the best use of its
resources, putting it a disadvantage and thus contributing to the Axis
defeat.</p>
<h1 id="over-stretched-empire">Over-stretched Empire</h1>
<p>One reason the Axis powers lost WW2 was due to Japan's overstretched
empire.</p>
<p>The Japanese were unable to effectively leverage the empire they had
expanded from 1931 to 1941. The Japanese empire was very spread out. In
many areas, rail and road communications were poor, so it was difficult
to deliver raw materials and workers efficiently to the places where
they were needed.</p>
<p>This inability to effectively allocate its resources due to its size
meant that the Japanese empire was at a disadvantage and thus
contributed to its defeat by the Allies.</p>
<h1 id="poor-planning-japan">Poor Planning (Japan)</h1>
<p>The Japanese failed to understand that the war at sea had changed by
1941. Air power, in the form of aircraft based carriers, was now far
more important than traditional naval power like battleships. Therefore,
while the Japanese damaged US battleships during the attack on Pearl
Harbour, they did not destroy any US aircraft carriers, as they were not
located at the base. This outcome allowed the US navy to recover from
the attack quickly.</p>
<p>This failure to recognise that the nature of a naval warfare had
changed and adapt to a focus on carrier based combat meant that the
Japanese empire was at a disadvantage and thus contributed to its defeat
by the Allies.</p>
<h1 id="lack-of-local-support">Lack of Local Support</h1>
<p>The Japanese were unable to make the best use of their empire because
of how brutally they had treated the peoples they conquered. They looted
the resources of the conquered lands. They also abused the locals and
forced thousands into slave labour. This resulted in millions of
civilian deaths under Japanese rule. As a result, the conquered peoples
began to resist in any way they could against the Japanese. For example,
in Vietnam, the nationalist leader Ho Chi Minh led the Viet Minh in a
guerilla campaign which eventually wore down the Japanese.</p>
<p>The lack of local support within its empire meant that the Japanese
could not effectively extract the resources it needed from the
territories it controlled. That said lack of support also often led to
outright resistance also drained Japanese military forces as they would
be required to be redeployed to suppress such forces. This thus caused
the Japanese empire to be put at a disadvantage, contributing to its
defeat by the Allies.</p>
