<p>He applauds the availability of the common consumer goods. “It is a

implies that author’s approval of globalisation despite recognising the

distinctive traits. The author believes the common experiences will
bring about togetherness. This is in contrast to author B’s stance, thus
not in agreement.</p>

<p>Source E is useful as it is reliable. Source E tells me Pokemon Go
has caused many people to venture out to different areas in their
purusit of the Pokemons. This is evident in Source E, "We don't know
that it's attracting people who wouldn't have otherwise come, but it's a
fair assumption that some passing players will pop in to play." This
implies that Pokemmon Go allows many players to explore places that they
have not explored before. This is supported by Source D, which tells me
that Pokemon Go has caused many people to venture out to different areas
in their pursuit of the Pokemon. This is evident in Source D, "</p>
<p>Source E is not useful as it is not reliable. Source E tells me
Pokemon Go is perceived to the beneficial and is welcomed by the
properties.<br />
This is evident from the source "At the very least, it flags up to
players nearby that the Museum exits. It's free advertising with a huge
audience." This implies that some properties recognised the merits of
Pokemon Go and welcomed Pokemon Go as a platform to attract visitors.
This is contradicted by Source D, which tells me Pokemon Go is perceived
to be detrimental and is not welcomed by the properties. This is evident
in the source "religious leaders here are worried that the game might
provoke many to enter places of worship, disturbing prayer and creating
law and order problems."<br />
This implies that some properties view Pokemon Go as causing disrupting
the physical space and also orderliness of the space.<br />
This contradiction makes Source E unreliable, hence, not useful.</p>
