A: Adapted from an extract on the relevance of CMIO classification in
policies from the Straits Times newspaper, 24 January 2022.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to be able to manage this, so having (CMIO) labels allows us
to administer policies… It's a piece of information that allows you to
take action. How this stance evolves comes down to the extent to which
the Government needs to keep intervening and managing such issues. The
day when people no longer use race or skin colour as an identifier is
the day when policies that differentiate by race would be meaningless.
The EIP, for example, will become less and less relevant as people
naturally choose to live in diverse neighbourhoods. However, the fact
that there are still a lot of applications that potentially could be
rejected - because they have met the quota - means that there is still a
tendency for people to want to congregate in a way that we think doesn't
promote cohesion and a shared lived experience in a neighbourhood.</p>

Source A. What is the message of this source?</h2>
<p>The message of the source is that CMIO categorisation is still
relevant in policy making in Singapore as Singaporeans are still not
ready for the removal of CMIO categorisation/do not demonstrate
readiness in living in a diverse society.</p>
<p>The evidence is "...having (CMIO) labels allows us to administer
policies… It's a piece of information that allows you to take action."
In addition, "However, the fact that there are still a lot of

the quota - means that there is still a tendency for people to want to

<p>An extract from a CNA commentary, “I am Peranakan not Chinese”, 8 Feb
2021.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Are you Chinese or Malay?”, people often ask me. For many years, as
a Peranakan growing up in Kampong Potong Pasir, I was caught in an
identity crisis. My skin was more brown than other Chinese folks. I
didn’t speak Chinese; only Malay. I didn’t even have a Chinese name. The
only Chinese thing about me was my surname. Peranakans fall in between
the cracks of our traditional notions of race. Many of us in Singapore
dress and talk like the Malays, and we struggle to identify with the
Chinese. However, we eat pork and celebrate the Lunar New Year so we
don’t belong to the Malay or Muslim camp either. Unfortunately, for me,
my identity card (IC) says I am Chinese but I personally would rejoice
if my IC says Peranakan, not Chinese.</p>

<p><span style="color:red">I am not surprised by the Peranakan lady's
opinion on the CMIO categorisation as it shows that the CMIO
categorisation is not relevant due to its failure to categorise major
races that do not belong to any general group. The source states that
"Peranakans fall in between the cracks of our traditional notions of
race. Many of us in Singapore dress and talk like the Malays, and we
struggle to identify with the Chinese." Additionally, the Peranakans
"eat pork and celebrate the Lunar New Year so we don’t belong to the
Malay or Muslim camp either." Hence, the CMIO categorisation fails to
categorise culturally relevant races that do not belong to any one of
the particular groups, failing to differentiate races that are
significantly distinct from the official groups due to their
culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red">This is not surprising to me as Source D is
supported by the background information, which tells me that the CMIO
categorisation is not relevant due to its failure to categorise major
races that do not belong to any general group. It states that "the CMIO
model is problematic in a number of ways, for example, within the C, M
and I categories, the model does not differentiate between local-born
and foreign-born Chinese, Malays and Indians. The Others’ category also
does not distinguish between distinct groups such as ethnic Koreans,
Americans and Filipinos - groups with unique cultural histories." This
shows that the CMIO model is too general in attempting to categorise the
races and cultural groups in Singapore without resorting to excessive
generalisation, and is thus not relevant in the modern context of
Singapore where its cultural diversity has resulted in great varieties
of races that go beyond the CMIO categorisation.</span></p>
<p>As the background information supports Source D, Source D is thus
expected and not surprising.</p>
<h3 id="answer-key">Answer Key</h3>
<p>I am not surprised by Source D as it is similar to the Background
Information.</p>
<p>Source D tells me that the Peranakan lady is of the opinion that the
CMIO categorisation is irrelevant because it discriminates unique groups
by homogenising them with majority groups. The evidence is
"Unfortunately, for me, my identity card (IC) says I am Chinese but I
personally would rejoice if my IC says Peranakan, not Chinese." This
suggests that she thinks that the CMIO categorisation is irrelevant as
it homogenised her group as Chinese even though the Peranakans and
Chinese are distinct groups.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Background information also tells me that the CMIO</p>
<p>I am surprised by Source D as it is different from Source A.</p>

productively used despite the apparent distinction of groups. The
evidence from Source A is "We want to be able to manage this, so having
(CMIO) labels allows us to administer policies… It's a piece of

categorisation is useful to the government as it allows for the proper
implementation of government policies.</p>
<p>Since Source A is different from Source D, hence I am surprised by
the Peranakan lady's opinion in Source D that the CMIO categorisation is
irrelevant.</p>
<p>I am not surprised by Source D as it is by a Peranakan lady whose
group is not recognised but homogenised together with the Chinese even
though her group only share some cultural aspects of the Chinese.</p>
