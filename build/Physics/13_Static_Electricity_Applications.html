<li>The metal drum inside the photocopier is coated with
<strong>selenium</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Selenium is a <strong>photoconductor</strong> (light-sensitive
semiconductor). It only conducts electricity in the presence of light.
When no light shines on the selenium, it is a good insulator.</li>
<li>The selenium coating on the drum is initially in the dark. Behaving
as an insulator, it can be electrically charged. When the selenium is
illuminated, it becomes conducting wherever light falls on it.</li>
<li>The drum's surface is charged <strong>positively</strong> by a
charged wire.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The original image to be photocopied is placed on a sheet of clear
glass above the drum.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>An intense light beam is shone onto the image.</li>
<li>The <strong>darker</strong> areas of the image reflect less light
and therefore, the corresponding regions on the drum remain
<strong>positively</strong> charged.</li>
<li>The regions on the drum corresponding to the
<strong>lighter</strong> areas conductive. Electrons from the
surroundings, which are attracted to these regions, discharge them.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>The drum continues turning, and the positively-charged image on
the drum attracts the <strong>negatively-charged</strong> toner
powder.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>positively-charged</strong> sheet of paper is passed
over the drum's surface.</p></li>
</ol>

paper permanently.</li>

<h3 id="removing-fly-ash-from-the-exhaust-gas">Removing fly ash from the

<p>The fly ash (smoke and dust particles) is passed through a negatively
charged wire grid making the particles to become negatively charged. The
negatively charged particles are passed through positively charged or
earthed plates which attract the negatively charged particles. Hence,
air emitted into the atmosphere is cleaner. The fly ash are collected
and used in making cement.</p>
<h2 id="spray-painting">Spray Painting</h2>

<li>The electrostatic spray painter is used to provide an even coat on
the part to be painted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="even-coating">Even Coating</h3>
<p>As the paint leaves the nozzle, the droplets are charged by friction.
These made all the paint droplets to have the same charge and repel each
other. Hence, they spread out evenly. Less paint is needed because the
charged droplets are all attracted to the object (neutral or positively
charged).</p>
