# Argumentative Essay Questions

## Analysing the Question

- __Purpose:__ To understand the points that you must address for your readers to be convinced of your stand.
- __Effect:__ Convinced by the writer's point of view as identified points are addressed by logical, relevant, credible and well-elaborated ideas supported with ideas.

Read the essay prompt twice before identifying:
- The TASK words, which define __what you have to do__
- The TOPIC words, which define __what you should focus on__
- The CONTEXTUAL words, which define __the limits of your discussion__

These three sets of keywords enable you to stay on task, i.e., organised and relevant.

> "How far would you agree?"
> Show extent of your agreement; argument must be balanced

### Question 1: "Technology has given youths more opportunities than ever." Do you agree? Why or why not?

        + Social networking avenues
    * Advocacy
        + Campaign for social change

__Loaded Words__

    * Comparison between past and present
- "has given"
    * Past-continuous tense
        + Past and present
            + Compare

#### Mistakes

- Focusing __only__ on social media
    * Should extend on other forms of technology e.g:
        + Robots, automation
        + Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    * A better response would straddle at least two types of technology.

### Question 3: "Education should only focus on STEM subjects." Do you agree? Why or why not?

    * Society is more STEM and technology focused
        + Schools have to match the industry's needs
            + Examples: IT, biomedical, pharmaceutical
