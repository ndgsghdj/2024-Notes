# Practical Planning

 ## Steps
 
$$T = \frac{kd}{r^2}$$

Assuming you fix $d$,

 1. Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram (if a diagram is drawn)
 2. Independent Variable: I change
     * $r$, the radius
     * Always the one easier to change
     * __Planning terminology__: "Use [instrument] to measure and record ..."
 3. Dependent Variable: I observe
     * $T$, the time taken
     * __Planning terminology__: "Calculate ..."
         + Calculate __[physical quantity]__ by using $\frac{1}{r^2}$
 4. Repeat step ... to ... for ... further values of __[independent variable]__
 5. Tabulate all the results for __[all measured and calculated quantities]__
 6. Plot a graph of ... against ...
