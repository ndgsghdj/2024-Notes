## Reflection

### Laws of Reflection

1. The first law of reflection states that the __incident ray,__ __reflected ray__, and the __normal__ at the point of incidence all lie in the __same plane__.
2. The second law of reflection states that the __angle of incidence, $i$__ is __equal__ to the __angle of reflection, $r$__.

### Characteristics of an Image Formed by a Plane Mirror

1. It is __laterally inverted.__
2. It is the __same shape__ and __same size__ as the object
3. It is __upright__
4. It is __virtual__
    - A virtual image __cannot be formed on a screen__
    - (Real) light rays do not meet at the image position.
5. Its __image distance__ from the mirror is the __same__ as the __object distance__ from the mirror.

### Types of Reflection

- For __both__ regular and irregular surfaces, the laws of reflection apply to each ray.

#### Regular Reflection

- On __smooth surfaces__, reflection is __regular__.
- Parallel incident rays have the same angles of incidence and refraction.
- The __reflected rays__ travel in the same direction.

#### Irregular (Diffuse) Reflection

- On __rough / irregular surfaces, __reflection is __diffused__. (Sometimes, the roughness may not be detectable by the naked eye.)
- The normal at different points of the surface are not parallel to one another.
- Thus, even if the incident rays are parallel, they have different angles of incidence and reflection. The __reflected rays__ travel in __different directions__.
- The overall diffused image is made up of many image points at different locations.

## Refraction

- __Refraction__ is the __bending__ of light as it travels from one optical medium to another with a __different refractive index__.
- Refraction is caused by a __change in the speed of light__ as light travels from one medium to another medium.
- __Normal__ is an imaginary straight line that is perpendicular to the surface of the medium.
- __Angle of incidence ($i$)__ is the __angle __between the __incident ray__ and the __normal__
- __Angle of refraction ($r$)__ is the __angle__ between the __refracted ray__ and the __normal__
- The __incident ray__, the __refracted ray__, and the __normal at the point of incidence__ all lies in the __same plane__.
