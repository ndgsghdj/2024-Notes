## Magnetic Effect of a Current

### Properties of the Magnetic Field of a Current-carrying Conductor

- A current-carrying conductor produces a __magnetic field__ around it.

### Methods to Determine the Magnetic Field Around The Wire

1. Grip the wire with your right hand such that your thumb points in the direction of current flow.
2. The direction in which your fingers curl indicates whether the magnetic field is clockwise or anticlockwise.

#### Symbols

- __Dot__ at the middle shows wire carrying current __out__ of the wire
- __Cross__ at the middle shows wire carrying current __into__ of the wire

#### Properties

- Magnetic fields of a long, straight current-carrying conductor are represented by __concentric circles__ which are centered at the conductor itself.
- The __closer__ the field lines, the __greater__, the magnetic field strength (or the __stronger the magnetic field__)

### Factors affecting Magnetic Field Strength of a Solenoid

- A solenoid is a coil of insulated wire coiled into a cylinder shape.
- The magnetic field of a solenoid resembles that of a bar magnet.
- The __Right-hand Grip Rule__ can be applied to the solenoid to determine the direction of the magnetic field inside the solenoid.
    * Curl your __fingers__ around in the direction of the __current__ flow.
    * Your __thumb__ will point to the __North__ pole.

#### Factors that affect the strength of an electromagnet.

The magnetic field strength of a solenoid can be increased by:
1. Increase the magnitude of the __current__
2. Increase the __number of turns on the solenoid__, or
3. Placing a soft iron core within the solenoid to concentrate the magnetic field lines.

Note: The magnetic field strength __inside__ the solenoid is stronger than the magnetic field strength outside the solenoid.

## Force on a Current-carrying Conductor (Lorentz Force)

| Cases                                    | Observations                                                                                         |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spacing Between Magnets (Field Strength) | The wire gets a larger force when the spacing decreases (magnetic field gets stronger)               |
| Reversing Current Flow Direction         | The wire gets a force in the opposite direction when direction of the current is reversed.        |
| Reversing Magnetic Field Direction       | The wire gets a force in the opposite direction when direction of the magnetic field is reversed. |

### Conclusion

The __magnetic force__ produced on the current-carrying wire:
1. __Increases__ when the __magnetic field__ gets __stronger__
2. __Reverses__ in direction when the direction of the __electric current__ is __reversed,__ and
3. __Reverses__ in direction when the direction of the __magnetic field__ is __reversed__

![Figure 1](./18_Electromagnetism/figure1.png)

- The diagram shows how the magnetic fields, produced by a current-carrying wire and a pair of magnets, interact with each other.
- There is a stronger magnetic field on the one side of the wire at A. All the magnetic field lines at A act in the same direction.
- There is a weaker magnetic field on one side of the wire at B. The magnetic field lines of the current carrying conductor act in the opposite direction of that of the magnet.
- The __interaction__ between the __current flowing in the conductor__ and the __external magnetic field__ produced a __force acting on the conductor.__
- The direction of the force acting on the conductor can be determined by Fleming's left hand rule.

### Fleming's Left Hand Rule

- Fleming's left-hand rule is used to find the direction of force when the direction of magnetic field and conventional current are known.
- The first three fingers are positioned at __right angles__ to each other.

1. Thumb: __Force__ on conductor
2. First finger: __Field__ (magnetic field)
3. Second finger: <ins>Conventional</ins> __Current__

### Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field

- Fleming's left-hand rule can be applied to all __moving charges.__
- __NOTE:__ For a beam of __charged particles__ (e.g electrons or protons), we need to follow the direction of the __conventional current__, which is __opposite in direction to the motion of negative charges.__

![Figure 2](./18_Electromagnetism/figure2.png)

- While an electric force is always exerted on a charge within an electric field, a magnetic force is only exerted on a charge within a magnetic field if it is __moving.__
- For a __stationary__ charge within a magnetic field experiences __zero magnetic force.__
- For a __moving charge__, the direction of the force acting on the charge is perpendicular to the direction of travel.
- The __moving particle__ is deflected in a __circular path__ towards the centre of the circle.

## The DC Motor

- A DC motor converts __electrical energy__ into __mechanical energy__.
- A DC motor consists of the following components.
    * __Rectangular coil__ connected in series to a battery and rheostat.
    * __Permanent magnets__
    * __Split-ring commutator__
        + The ends of the coil are __fixed__ to the split-ring commutator 
    * __Two carbon brushes__
        + The carbon brushes rub against the commutator and keep the coil connected to the battery.

When the switch is closed, current will flow through the (rectangular) __conducting coil.__

The sides of the coil lie in between two __permanent magnets__.

Forces are produced on the current-carrying wires of the coil as the magnetic fields interact, which cause the coil to rotate about its axle 

The ends of the rotating coil are connected to two halves of a copper ring known as the __split ring commutator__ and they __rotate together with the coil.__

Electric current is passed from the circuit to the two halves of the copper ring via two separate __carbon brushes__.

The rheostat is used to control the __amount of current in the coil__, which affects the __strength of magnetic forces__ produced on the sides of the coil, the amount of the moment of these forces about PQ and hence the __rotational speed__ of the coil.

### How it Functions

- When an electric current flows through the coil ABCD, a __backward force is produced on side AB and an upward force on side CD__ (using Fleming's left-hand rule).
    * This causes the coil to __rotate anticlockwise__ about axis PQ.
- But when the rotating coil reaches __vertical position__, the split ring commutator (X and Y) __loses contact with the carbon brushes__, causing the current to be __cut off__ and the forces to __disappear.__
- However, the __inertia__ of the rotating coil keeps it rotating and the commutator to make contact with the brushes again but in the reverse manner.
- This __reverses the current direction in the coil__, and consequently side __AB now gets an upward force__ while __CD gets a downward force.__
- This allows the coil to continue rotating in the same anticlockwise direction.

### Total Moment

- The __total moment of the magnetic forces__ and the __rotational speed__ can be __increased by__:
    * __Increasing__ the magnitude of the __current__ in the coil.
    * Increasing the __number of turns __on the coil.
    * Inserting a __soft iron core__ into the coil.
    * Using a __stronger__ magnet.
