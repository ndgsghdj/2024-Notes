# Pressure

## Definition of Pressure

Pressure is defined as __force acting per unit area.__

$$\rho = \frac{F}{A}$$

where:

- $\rho$ is the pressure (SI unit: pascal , Pa)
- $F$ is the force (SI unit: newton, N), and
- $A$ is the (contact) area (SI unit: square metre, $m^2$)

__Note:__ $1 \space \pu{Pa} = 1 \space \pu{N/m^2}$

## Transmission of Pressure in Hydraulic System

Submerge:

- A syringe that has a plunger with a small cross-sectional area,
- A syringe with a plunger with a large cross-sectional area, and
- A rubber tube

into coloured water.

Fill the smaller syringe completely with the coloured water. Squeeze any air bubbles out of the rubber tube. Leave the larger syringe cross-sectional areas unfilled.

Connect each end of rubber tubing to the nozzle of each syringe. Remove the set-up from the coloured water.

To move both plungers at a constant speed, either plunger may be pressed separately.

1. Compared to the force needed to be exerted on the plunger with the larger cross-sectional area, a smaller force needs to be exerted on the plunger with the smaller cross-sectional area
2. When the smaller plunger is moved by a given distance, the larger plunger moves by a shorter distance and vice-versa.

## Pascal's Principle

When pressure is applied to an enclosed incompressible liquid, the pressure is __transmitted equally__ to all other parts of the liquid.

### Hydraulic Press

1. A force $F_X$ is exerted on piston 1. The pressure exerted at point $X$ is $\rho_X = \frac{F_X}{A_X}$
2. This pressure is transmitted equally to every part of the liquid, including to point Y.
3. A force, $F_Y$ is applied onto the base of piston 2
4. Thus,
$$\rho_X = \rho_Y \\\\ \frac{F_X}{A_X} = \frac{F_Y}{A_Y}$$
Equivalently, $\frac{F_X}{F_Y} = \frac{A_X}{A_Y}$$
5. Since $A_X < A_Y$, $F_X < F_Y$
6. Since the liquid is incompressible, the volume displaced at point X is equal to the volume displaced by point Y.
$$V_X = V_Y \\ A_X d_X = A_Y d_Y$$
Equivalently, $\frac{A_X}{A_Y} = \frac{d_Y}{d_X}$
7. Since $A_X < A_Y$, $d_X < d_Y$
8. To summarise, $\frac{F_X}{F_Y} = \frac{A_X}{A_Y} = \frac{d_Y}{d_X}$

__Suggest why a hydraulic press does not work properly if the hydraulic liquid contains gas bubbles__

A gas is compressible. Pressure will not be transmitted equally between the pistons.

## Hydraulic Brake System

![Hydraulic Brake System](05_Pressure/hydraulic_brake_system.png)

Each large piston exerts a force that is equal to the force exerted by the driver multiplied by the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the large piston to the cross-sectional area of the small piston.

$$\frac{F_{small}}{A_{small}} = \frac{F_{large}}{A_{large}}$$

$$F_{large} = F_{small} \times \frac{A_{large}}{A_{small}}$$

## Density

### Definition

__Density__ is defined as mass per unit volume.

$$\rho = \frac{m}{v}$$

When an insoluble solid is placed in a liquid, the soild will:

1. __float__ of its (average) density is __less than__ that of the liquid.
2. __sink__ of its (average) density is __greater than__ that of the liquid.
3. be __suspended__ of its (average) density is __equal to__ that of the liquid.

## Pressure due to a liquid column

### Formula for liquid pressure

Consider a cuboidal liquid column of density $\rho$, base area $A$ and a depth $h$. The atmosphere (of pressure $p_0$) exerts a downward force $F_0$ on the top of the liquid. There is an upward force $F$ acting at the bottom surface of the liquid, which is at pressure $\rho$. The liquid column is in equilibrium and the gravitational field strength is at $g$.

1. $V = Ah$
2. $m = \rho \times V \times g = \rho Ahg$
3. weight, $W = m \times g = \rho Ahg$
