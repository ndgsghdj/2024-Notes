# Radioactivity

## Composition of an Atom

- An atom is very tiny and typically has a size of __$1 \times 10^{-10} \pu{m}$__.
- It is made up of __subatomic particles__ such as protons, neutrons and electrons.
- An atom consists of a positively charged nucleus and negatively charged electrons moving around the nucleus.
- The nucleus of an atom consists of two types of particles - protons and neutrons.
- Strong attractive electrostatic forces between the positively charged nucleus and negatively charged electrons hold the electrons to the atom.

### Proton (atomic) Number Z.

- The __proton number $Z$__ is the number of protons in an atom.
- The proton number is also known as the __atomic number__.
- In a neutral atom, the number of protons is the same as the number of electrons.
- Each element has a unique proton number.

### Nucleon (Mass) Number A

- Proton and neutrons are called __nucleons__.
- The __nucleon number__ is the total number of neutrons and protons in the nucleus of an atom.
- The symbol $A$ is used to represent the nucleon number of an element.
- The nucleon number is also known as the __mass number.__
- The mass of an atom depends on the mass of nucleons in the nucleus of the atom as the mass of an electron is very small and thus negligible.
- To find the number of neutrons in an atom,

$$Number \space of \space neutrons = A - Z$$

- Note that in nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, the various species of atoms whose nuclei contain a particular number of protons and neutrons are called __nuclides.__
- The nucleus of an atom can be represented by the __nuclide notation:__

$$\ce{^{A}_{Z}X}$$

### Isotopes

- __Isotopes__ are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.
- Isotopes of the same elements have *identical* chemical properties.
- Example: carbon isotopes

## Nuclear Decay

- __Nuclear decay__ is also known as radioactive decay or radioactivity.
- Nuclear decay is a random process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses its energy by emission of electromagnetic radiation or particle(s).
- The radiation emitted by a radioactive nucleus is *spontaneous* and *random* in direction.
- Spontaneous decay means that the decay is not affected by environmental changes (e.g. temperature and pressure.)
- Random decay means that the decay cannot be predicted which particular nucleus will decay next.
- A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive.
- The instability of the atomic nuclei is because the nuclear forces within the nuclei are not enough to bind the nucleons together.
- Since the direction of the emissions and the time between emissions cannot be predicted, hence it is:
    * not possible to make the radioactive nucleus emit radiation by heating, cooling, chemical means or any other method;
    * not possible to predict when a radioactive nucleus will emit radiation; and
    * not possible to know the direction in which the emitted radiation will leave a nucleus.

### Types of Nuclear Emission

There are three types of nuclear emission: __alpha ($\alpha$) particles, beta ($\beta$) particles and gamma ($\gamma$) rays.__ Different nuclear emissions have different compositions, ionising effects and penetrating abilities.

__Ionisation__ refers to the ability to eject electrons from atoms to form positively charged cations. Since the atoms lose electrons, the number of protons is greater than the number of electrons. Thus, ions carry a charge. The nuclei of the same isotope will emit the same type of nuclear radiation. During alpha decay or beta decay, the nucleus changes to that of a different element.

#### Alpha Decay

- When a radioactive nucleus undergoes alpha decay:
    * it emits an alpha particle (identical to helium nucleus $\ce{^4_2He}$)
    * the nucleon number A decreases by 4
    * the proton number Z decreases by 2
- A __nuclide equation__ involving nuclide notation can be used to represent the changes in the composition of the nucleus. The arrow in the equation means "reacts to form".

Example: Radium-226 (Ra) nucleus emits an alpha particle and decays to radon-222 (Rn).

$$\ce{^{226}_{88}Ra -> ^{222}_{86}Rn + ^4_2He}$$

Note that in a nuclear reaction, the __mass and charge are conserved.__ Hence, before and after the reaction,
- The total number of neutrons and protons remain constant, and
- The total relative charge should also be the same (i.e. sum of proton number before and after decay should be the same.)

#### Beta Decay

- When a radioactive nucleus undergoes ÃŸ-decay:
    * it emits
