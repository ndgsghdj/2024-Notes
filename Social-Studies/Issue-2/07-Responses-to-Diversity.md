# Responding to Socio-Economic Diversity

## Responses of Individuals

Individuals can play their part and respond by contributing their time, effort and money to meet areas of need in society. For example:

- They can start ground-up initiatives and mobilise resources to distribute food to those in need.
- They can also volunteer with existing organisations to provide services to other groups in society, such as helping out at mobile clinics.

| In 2014, Mr Nizar Mohamed Shariff started a charity called Free Food For All (FFFA) to provide nutritious halal food to the less fortunate, regardless of their race or religion. <br/><br/> Initially focused on delivering freshly cooked meals, FFFA now offers different food options and channels, which include ready-to-eat (RTE) meals, fresh vegetables, groceries and a weekly stocked community fridge. They also collaborate with other food businesses to cater RTE meals for their beneficiaries. <br/><br/>In 2021 alone, FFFA served more than 160,000 meals, which include RTE meals to more than 1,000 families a month. |
