## L3 Answer 
I am not surprised by this source as source F and Source B share the similar concern of the negative impact of globalisation on the society. This is evident from Source F, which tells me that "children who have access to TV prefer fancy western dress to our traditional dress" This implies youths have strong preference for western clothing and lifestyle. Similarly, this is seen in Source B, which tells me western fashion has dominated everyone as we can see from the source, the
characters bought apparel from Nike, Gap, and Disney store. This similarity makes it not surprising.

## L5/6 Answer
I am not surprised by Source F. It is made by Professor of Bhutan and Bhutan was a small mountainous kingdom, renowned for its rich tradition and culture. In the face of globalisation, it is expected for the professor to be protective of Bhutan's rich culture to prevent erosion of Bhutanese culture as he highlighted although English is taught. "It is quite embarrassing to see that our cultural identity and values have diminished". In addition, he raised the concerns of
western influences impacting the society negatively with vices such as "smoking, drugs, and gang fights" and also the erosion of culture as seen from "ignoring traditional songs and dances." Thus, from his concerns, it is natural for the government to implement a law to protect Bhutan form the negative influences of globalisation, as the professor, just like the government, is a firm believer/proponent of protecting Bhutan's culture. Therefore justifying the need for the law.
