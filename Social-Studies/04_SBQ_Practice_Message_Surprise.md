# SBQ Practice (Message and Surprise)
## Q1. Study Source A. What is the message of the source? Explain your answer.

One message is that the ageing population has an negative impact on economic growth as it results in an economic slowdown in a country and hence New Zealanders need to have the political will to support changes to existing policies to cater to the needs of their population, despite these measures being unpopular. This is evident in Source A which shows the elderly population still working as construction workers, postman, delivery workers which may be having issues
with their productivity as the workers seem lethargic and sleepy. In addition, the response from the elderly couple indicating their choice of "Letting more people into N.Z." shows that introducing younger foreign workers/new immigrants is a viable way to boost the productivity in the economy.

## Q2. Study Source D. How surprised are you by this source? Explain your answer.
