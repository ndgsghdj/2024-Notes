# Assertion Skills
## Key Understanding

1. Unpack the question issue

| Assertion | Inference |
|-----------|-----------|
| Stand     | P         |
| Evidence  | E         |
| Extension | E         |

B.S.A (Beyond the Source)

## Summary

Assertion comprises of:
- Prediction
- All sources except Background Information
    - Background Information can only be used for Surprise + Reliability + Utility
- Roles
    - Show the other roles
- Perspective (Y/N)

## What is Assertion?
### SBQ Assertion
- Last question in SBQ segment
- Requires an understanding of all sources
Assertion question is typically a <u> broader scope </u> compared to the SBCS issue.

> "The American healthcare system has been successful in meeting the healthcare needs of the American people."

__vs__

> "How much should the Government interfere in the provision of healthcare in the USA?"

## How to Approach Assertion?

### Steps to Approach Assertion
1. Categorise sources into two sides (e.g. agree/disagree)
2. Choose 2 sources from each side to address the question
3. Write one paragraph per source
    - Framework: Stand, Evidence, BSA (SE + BSA)

### Before we go any further...
Notice you only need to select <u> 4 sources out of the 6 </u> provided

Choose the __4__ that you are __most confident__ in.

### Mistakes to avoid

- Source A shows that "..." (No stand stated)
- I disagree with the statement as source A, D, and E contradicts the statement. Source A states "...", while source D states "..." and source E states "..." (Multiple sources in 1 paragraph)
- I disagree as the source mentions how people in America are not able to be insured if they have pre-existing conditions. (No specific source identified and no direct quote of the source)


## Writing Frames

### SE + BSA
- Stand
    - I agree with the statement as Source A supports it
    - I disagree with the statement as Source B contradicts it by showing <u>__________</u>
- Evidence
    - Source A states "..." (directly quote)
- Because... So... As a result (Linking to a larger context)

### How do I do BSA?
1. Identify the <u>__main information__</u> that the source is telling you

##### \* Predict the effect of this information

2. Because: Immediate impact/implication of the information
3. So: __Result__ of the immediate impact highlighted previously
4. As a result: __Wider outcome__ based on what was identified in your previous 2 portions.

| Larger Outcome (individual &rarr; community &rarr; national) | Further consequence (Because of this, something else will happen) |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

EIP &rarr; Common Space &rarr; Interaction &rarr; Understanding &rarr; Friendship &rarr; Overcome tensions &rarr; Reduce stereotypes &rarr; Manage challenges

_I agree with the statement as Source B supports it. Source B states "the ACA will offer you a variety of quality, affordable, private health insurance plans to choose from. Insurance companies will no longer be able to discriminate against any American with a pre-existing health condition". Because more individuals would be able to obtain access to affordable insurance coverage, so their medical needs would be addressed more promptly as individuals no longer have to worry about being
unable to afford the medical costs. As a result, the overall health of the American population would increase as illnesses are addressed more promptly and not allowed to deteriorate further, ensuring that a larger proportion of the population remains healthy for a longer period of time. Therefore, the American healthcare system has been successful in meeting the healthcare needs of the public._

### Analysis of Response

#### Evidence
The ACA will offer you a variety of quality, affordable, private health insurance plans to choose from. Insurance companies will no longer be able to discriminate against any American with a pre-existing health condition.

#### Because
More individuals would be able to obtain access to affordable insurance coverage.

#### So
Their medical needs would be addressed more promptly as individuals no longer have to worry about being unable to afford the medical costs.

#### As a result
The overall health of the American population would increase as illnesses are addressed more promptly and not allowed to deteriorate further, ensuring that a larger proportion of the population remains healthy for a longer period of time. Therefore, the American healthcare system has been successful in meeting the healthcare needs of the public.

## Point to Note for BSA
- __Cannot repeat__ similar analysis points for multiple sources
- Must ensure that you link to the __wider context__ beyond what the source tells you
- __Link back__ to the assertion statement.

## Bonus Tasks
1. Bring in own examples from contextual knowledge relevant to __a source__
    - Parallel example OR deeper insight
2. Reliability/utility of __a source__
3. [ VERY RISKY ] Balanced conclusion on the assertion statement (Why each view is valid. Explain why using provenance and association)
    - Very strictly marked during O Levels

## LORMS

| LORMS | Description                      | Mark |
|-------|----------------------------------|------|
| L1    | No valid use of source           | 1    |
| L2    | Valid use of source/s (A OR DA)  | 2-4  |
| L3    | Valid use of source/s (A AND DA) | 5-8  |
|       | Special Bonus                    | 8-10 |

### Types of Strategies

| Type            | Agree | Disagree | Basic Marks | Well-Supported Answer |
|-----------------|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Highest Marks   | 2     | 2        | 7m          | 8m                    |
| Time Constraint | 1     | 1        | 5m          | -                     |

### Example

#### Paragraph 1 [ Agree ]

- SEBSA [ L2/3 ]
- Contextual Knowledge [ +1m ]

#### Paragraph 2 [ Disagree ]

## Example Question

### Unpacking

> "Dyson's move to Singapore is bad for Britain." Using the sources in this case study, explain how far you would agree with this statement.
> "Individual responsibility is the best way to manage the spread of fake news" Using the sources...

#### Bad for Britain
- Job loss
- Decrease in GDP
- Decrease in revenue
- Slow economic growth

#### Government

- Resources
