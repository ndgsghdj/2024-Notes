# How Can We Respond to the Economic Impacts of Globalisation?

## Economic Impacts of Globalisation and Resopnses of Countries and Individuals

### Global Economy

- Countries trade in goods, such as food and appliances.
    * Others may buy and sell services, such as finance and education.
- Countries trade with one another as they may need/want goods and services they are unable to produce themselves or when produced by other countries, are cheaper and of better quality. Not all countries participate in international trade to the same degree.

Countries also participate in global economy by __investing__ in one another (international investment).

- Investments a country makes in another country or receives from another country are __foreign investments__.
- Foreign investments that involve businesses from one country setting up operations in another country or investing in businesses of another country are known as __foreign direct investments (FDIs)__. 
    * FDIs are typically for the long term.
- FDIs arise because businesses identify opportunities to reduce costs, increase profit or expand into other markets by setting up operations in another country or investing in businesses in another country.

When country receive FDIs, it often results in an inflow of foreign equipment, talent and expertise. This enables local businesses to upgrade their technology and business practices. FDIs benefit a country by:

- Helping to increase amount of goods and services produced locally; and
- Promoting transfer of skills and expertise to local businesses and workers and creating jobs with potentially higher wages.

    * Economic growth is increase in country's production of goods and services.
    * Can be measured using country's __Gross Domestic Product (GDP)__ over period of time.

##### Singapore's Growth

- __1965 to early 1970s__
    * After gaining independence in 1965, Singapore faced high unemployment rate
    * In response, government sought to attract foreign investments, particularly in labour-intensive industries (e.g. garment manufacturing and ship-building etc.)
    * Singapore enjoyed strong economic growth by end of 1960s to early 1970s.
    * Singaporeans had more jobs and higher wages.
- __1970s__
    * Higher wages led to higher labour costs.
        + Singapore became less competitive in labour-intensive industries compared to neighbouring countries with more labour and at cheaper costs.
        + Singapore begins attracting new foreign investments in higher-value industries (e.g. petrochemicals and engineering)
        + Focused on upskilling citizens to develop more educated workforce.
- __1980s to 2000s__
    * Singapore reviewed its economic strategy to ensure sustained growth.
    * Government focused on pursuing more trade, overseas investment and developing modern service sectors (e.g. finance and info-comm)

    * By 2018, 59 per cent of total number of tech-based MNCs in Asia had established regional headquarters in Singapore.
    * Singapore also invests overseas, with significant investments in China, India and Indonesia. As these countries have large populations and greater potential economic growth, investing in them will likely bring economic growth to Singapore.
