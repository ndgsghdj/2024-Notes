# What Are The Factors That Contribute To Globalisation?

## Driving Forces of Globalisation

Two driving forces:

1. Technological advancements in transportation and digital technology
2. Growth of Multinational Corporations (MNCs)

- __Globalisation__: the process through which ideas and activities of people living in different parts of the world become interconnected.
- These __interconnections__ are links created or established among people, businesses and countries through the movement of goods, services, people, knowledge and resources.
- Such interconnections lead to __interdependence__ where developments in the world (global) and developments in a specific place (local) affect one another. i.e. Events in one part of the world may affect other parts of the world.

## Technological Advancements

Over the years, __technological advancements__ have led to improvements in land, sea and air transportation.

| The Liverpool and Manchester Railway marked the beginning of steam-powered rail travel. The railway covered a distance of approximately 50 km and its trains travelled at about 48 km/h. | The Shinkansen bullet trains in Japan are among the world's fastest trains. As of 2023, the rail network covers a distance of around 3,478 km and its trains can travel up to 320 km/h. |

### Capacity

| 1800s                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Since 1956                                                                                                 |

| Steam-powered ships first sailed across the Atlantic Ocean between America and Europe, and later along shipping routes to Asia. Due to space taken up by its large engine and fuel, it had limited carrying capacity. | Depending on their size, container ships have a carrying capacity ranging from 25,000 to 600,000 tonnes. |

### Costs

| 1950s                                                                                                                                 | Since 1990s                                                                                                                                                   |

| In the 1950s, flying was considered a luxury experience. Apart from the affluent and business travellers, few people could afford it. | With the rise of low-cost airlines, the cost of flights has decreased substantially. With lower airfares, more people are able to afford air travel. |
