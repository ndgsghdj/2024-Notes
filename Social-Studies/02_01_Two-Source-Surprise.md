# Two Source Surprise

## Example Questions

### Example Question 1: After hearing James, are you surprised by what Jamie says?

- James: I think this movie is very interesting
- Jamie: I think this movie is very interesting
- Jan: I think this movie is very interesting

> No, I am not surprised because both of them found the movie interesting. In addition, 

### Example Question 3: After hearing James, are you surprised by what Jamie says?

- James: I think this movie is very interesting
- Jamie: I think this movie is not very interesting
- Jan: I think this movie is not very interesting

### Example Question 3: After hearing James, are you surprised by what Jamie says?

- James: I think this movie is very interesting
- Jamie: I think this movie is not very interesting
- Jan: I think this movie is very interesting

> Yes, I am surprised because they have different opinion on whether the movie is interesting.
> In addition, Jaime's opinion is contradicted by Jan's opinion that it is interesting. Thus, I am surprised by what Jamie says.

## Summary of the 3 Scenarios

### Key Principles for Content Analysis

- You should try to work on the source/s that you are surprised by
- You will apply comparison or/and cross-reference skills to check on expectancy
- Your conclusion should always be on the Primary Source

### Key things to note when answering Surprise Questions

#### Flexible Application

There is no fixed method, thus you need to read the sources and apply the move that you deemed to be suitable.

#### Focus on Logic of 'Expectancy'

Always ask yourself if what you actually see (i.e. the reality) in the main source is expected. Be clear of your logic.

## Higher Level Analysis

### Steps

1. Compare A and B
2. X-ref B and X

### Types of Higher Analysis Methods

- Tone
    * Don't
- Purpose
    * A <-> B = Content different and A -- B = Purpose different
        + "As both sources have differing purposes, this explains their content difference. Therefore, I am not surprised."
- Provenance
- Context
    * Need to read provenance very clearly
    * A and B content difference but A and B context different (different dates)  
        + Not surprised, context has changed

### GCE-O Level 2020 Question

__Does Source E make Source F surprising?__

> Source E makes Source F surprising as they are different on the impact of higher minimum wages on employment levels. Source E shows that higher minimum wages will increase employment levels. It states that "industries with many low-wage workers, such as retail and hospitality, show employment gains after a minimum wage rise." This shows that with greater minimum wage, there will be more workers in different industries, boosting employment and productivity. On the other hand, Source F shows that higher minimum wages will decrease employment levels. It states that "said a minimum wage may force employers to ‘pay more than the market rate for some types of labour’. This will result in making some workers more expensive to employ. ‘Not all employers would want to employ workers at this expensive rate, which could lead to lower levels of employment." This shows that given a minimum wage, employment will decrease as the cost of hiring workers will be too costly. Hence, even having a high minimum wage will decrease employment levels further. As Source E is different from Source F on the impact of higher minimum wages on employment levels, Source E makes Source F unexpected and thus surprising.

> However, Source E does not make Source F surprising as the context in which they are written is different. Source E is taken from an article on a Canadian news site in June 2017 based in Canada, where minimum wage laws have already existed for a long time. Hence, minimum wages have already seen their benefits in Canada, where companies and the market have already adapted to the presence of a minimum wage. However, Source F is taken from an online report of a conference held in Singapore in October 2018, where there have traditionally been no minimum wage laws. Hence, 

#### Answer

##### Stand

> Source E makes Source F surprising as they have differing opinions on whether minimum wages will impact the number of jobs.

OR

> Source E does not make Source F surprising as they have similar opinions that the business owners are unhappy / they would be affected negatively.

##### Higher Analysis

> Source E does not make Source F surprising because of the differing context.
> Minimum-wage policy had already been implemented in Canada but not in Singapore. This is evident from the source "Minimum wage will rise to Canadian $14 an hour in 2018 and $15 in 2019, which has prompted howls of protest by business." This shows that negative responses in Canada. However, Singapore has yet to implement. This is evident "There have been calls to implement a minimum wage to uplift disadvantaged workers."

> Manpower Minister is responsible for keeping employment rates high in Singapore, it is expected for Mrs Josephine Teo was clearly worried about the welfare of the people and thus wanted to highlight the negative consequences of minimum wage.

OR

> In addition, as the Manpower Minister, Mrs Josephine Teo might not want to be held responsible for the possible failing employment rates as a result of implementing the minimum wage, and thus she would rather be cautious about the plan
