# Inference

## Inference Steps

1. No HLA, just content

### ATQ

- "I can infer that Tom was [answer]"
    * Answer / Mirror the question

### Evidence

- "The sources states (textual) / shows (picture) ..."
    * List down what the source says

### Explanation [L3/4]

- Talking about why your evidence links to your inference
    * A lot easier when you understand what your inference is
        + Tip: Underline your inference in pencil
        + Need to explain your __keyword__
- Don't need to write a lot, just explain your keyword phrase

## Questions that require some form of inference to be made

- What can you __infer__ from this source about government policy?
- 

## Picture Analysis / Message

### Steps

#### EPIC

1. Events: What was happening during this time? (Context)
2. People: Who do the people represent?
3. Items: Are there specific props? What do they represent?
4. Caption: What can you tell from the caption?

#### Mistakes

1. Do not give sub-messages
    - Hyper-focusing on one aspect of the picture
2. Do not do HLA

#### Tips

1. Most of the time, the message aligns with the big question
    - Don't force-fit
2. Do 1, not 2
    - If you have time, come back to do 1 more for 1m
