# SRQ Practice on Fake News

## Extract 1

> Extract 1 highlights the potential harms that fake news can inflict on a country.
>
> In your opinion, what are the __harmful__ impacts of fake news on Singapore? Explain 2 impacts.

One harmful impact of fake news on Singapore is the undermining of public trust in institutions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, false information about the virus and the government's response spread rapidly. For instance, there were false claims about the safety and efficacy of vaccines and misinformation regarding the lockdown measures. An example of this is Truth Warriors, a group which shared links to articles produced by several foreign doctors and overseas groups that have been discredited by organisation such as the CDC. Describing itself as a "community repository of evidence-based information on global developments surrounding Covid-19", sharing information on SG Suspected Vaccine Injuries and SG Covid La Kopi Telegram groups. When fake news spread misinformation about public health measures, it can lead to confusion and panic among the population. People may become skeptical of official information and less likely to follow government directives, which are crucial for managing public health crises. This undermines the government's ability to effectively govern and protect its citizens. The spread of fake news can erode the credibility of public institutions, making it harder for them to gain the public's trust and cooperation in the future. Therefore, it is vital to address and counteract fake news to maintain public trust in institutions and ensure effective governance, especially during crises. Hence, fake news can significantly harm Singapore by undermining trust in public institutions.

## Extract 2 and 3

> Extracts 2 and 3 highlight the roles of the government and social media companies in managing the spread of fake news.
>
> Do governments or social media companies play a more significant role in the spread of fake news? Explain your answer.

The role of the government in the spread of fake news is to create and enforce laws to combat the spread of fake news. For instance, Singapore has the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), which allows authorities to order the removal or correction of false information. As the government has the legal and constitutional power to enact legal policies to combat the spread of fake news, it is the role of the government to enforce policies that make the spread of fake news highly risky to do, deterring malicious actors from spreading fallacies which may undermine public trust in national institutions or erode social cohesion. As a result, manpower and agencies can be deployed to actively combat and respond to fake news incidents, calling on threat actors to cease the spread of fallacies before devastating damage to the social fabric of Singapore can be done.

However, social media companies also play a role in the spread of fake news through the management of content posted on their platforms. Social media companies have the responsibility to moderate content posted on their platforms, ensuring that information in posts are accurate and inoffensive. They thus also have the responsibility to curb and blacklist accounts that deliberately and maliciously incite discord among netizens through the spread of fake news. An example is Instagram's fact-checking feature, which depends on users to report false content they see on Instagram. Posts which contain false content will thereby carry alerts to users who come across them, informing them of possible fallacies in the posts. As social media companies have direct access to the content and data passing through their platform, they have the responsibility of being the first responders to posts with false content. Therefore, it is the role of social media companies to actively prevent fake news from spreading by blacklisting accounts or posts before they go viral, an ability which third-party agencies do not have. Thus, social media companies play a role in the spread of fake news.
