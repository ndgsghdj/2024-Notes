Kellogg-Briand Pact, 1928, "This was an agreement between 65 nations not to use force to settle disputes. There was no clear way on how to enforce the pact.

Abyssinian Crisis, 1934–1936, "Italy launched an invasion of Abyssinia. Abyssinia appealed to the League for help. The Abyssinian Crisis damaged global confidence in the League for good. The leak of the Hoare-Laval Pact damaged the reputation of the League to be able to act against aggressor countries. Furthermore, the failure to impose sanctions on Italy decisively led to the Italian takeover of Abyssinia. As a result, Hitler was convinced that the League would not be able to hinder Germany’s plan of expansion. "
Hoare-Laval Pact, 1935, "fearful of driving Italy into the arms of Germany, the foreign ministers of Britain and France, Samuel Hoare and Pierre Laval, secretly discussed the Hoare-Laval Pact with Mussolini in December 1935"

Warsaw Pact Summit, July 1988, "Gorbachev made a speech at the summit stating his intention to withdraw large numbers of Soviet troops, tanks and aircraft from other communist states. In March 1989, Gorbachev made clear to the Warsaw Pact leaders that the Soviet army would leave Eastern Europe and would no longer prop their countries up. In the months that followed, there was a sudden and dramatic collapse of communism across Eastern Europe. For example, in October 1989, Hungary declared itself a democratic republic rather than a communist republic. Furthermore, on 9 November, the guards abandoned the Berlin Wall, and jubilant crowds began to dismantle it."
