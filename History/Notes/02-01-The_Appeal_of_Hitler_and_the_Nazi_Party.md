# The Appeal of Hitler and the Nazi Party

# Background

Whilst the Weimar Republic was struggling to run Germany, a right-wing movement was slowly building in Bavaria (in South Germany)

One of the key groups was the **German Workers’ Party** *(Deutsche Arbeiterpartei/DAP)* founded by Anton Drexler in January 1919.

Adolf Hitler (then an army intelligence officer aka a spy) was sent to investigate the DAP.

- He found he agreed with their ideas
- In September 1919, he joined the DAP

Hitler was an excellent speaker and began to build a personal following.

- He argued that the party needed more nationalist policies to get more support

In February 1920, the DAP was renamed into the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (Nazis)

At the same time, they set out the Nazis’ main beliefs in the 25-point programme.

Nazi’s main beliefs in the 25-point programme:

- Abolition of the Treaty of Versailles
- Anschluss (union) between Germany and Austria
- Only “true” Germans to be allowed to live in Germany.
    - Jews in particular to be excluded
- Generous provision for old-age pensioners
- Nationalisation of large industries and businesses
- Creation of a strong central government

## Hitler becomes Leader of the Nazi Party

In July 1921, Hitler overthrew Drexler and becomes leader of the Nazi party

- Appointed allies to key roles
    - E.g. Hermann Goering was put in charge of the Stormtroopers (Sturmabteilung/SA/Brownshirts)

**Who were the Brownshirts?**

- Ex-soldiers who were members of the Nazi party
- Started as an informal group that provided security at Nazi events
- Hitler transformed them into a private army with uniforms and a command structure
- Hitler used them against rivals both within and outside the party.

By November 1923, there were around 50,000 members of the Nazi Party.

- Many of these were from the thousands of Germans who turned up to hear Hitler speak at Nazi meetings
    - Many were impressed by Hitler and the energy and commitment of the Nazis

On November 1923, Hitler launched the Munich Putsch

- Why?
    - By then the Weimar Republic had experienced years of problems
    - Hitler was popular and well known in Munich
    - He had support of important figures e.g. Erich Ludendorff
- What happened?
    - Hitler and his followers marched on the city of Munich
    - He expected the local government, police and troops to support him
    - They were instead met by armed police and a battle broke out
    - 16 Nazis and 4 policemen were killed
- Aftermath
    - Nazi Party was banned
    - Key Nazi leaders escaped harsh punishment
        - Ludendorff faced no punishment
            - Was elected to the Reichstag in 1924
    - Hitler escaped but was arrested 2 days later
        - Was allowed by the judge and used his trial to make long speeches criticising the Weimar Republic and setting out his ideas
        - The trail was covered extensively and Hitler became a national celebrity
        - Eventually sentenced to 5 years in Landsberg Prison
            - He only served 9 months
            - Conditions for him in the prison were very comfortable
                - He had visitors and access to books
            - He spent the time writing *Mein Kampf*
        - Powerful groups (e.g. judges) held similar views/were influenced by the Nazis
        - After the Munich Putsch, Hitler concluded that the Nazis could not seize power by force
            - They had to work within the democratic system
        - As soon as he was released from prison, Hitler rebuilt the Nazi Party towards the above goal
            - He did so based on the ideas he outlined in *Mein Kampf*
    - Key ideas in Mein Kampf
        - Total loyalty to the leader (Fuehrer aka Hitler)
        - Loyalty to Germany, racial purity, equality and state control
        - Aryans (Blond, blue-eyed, tall and of Nordic origin and descent) were the master race
            - All other races, especially the Jews, were inferior
        - War and struggle were essential to the development of a healthy Aryan race
        - Germany needed Lebensraum (living space)
            - It would mainly achieved through expansion into Russia and Poland

## Winning Support for the Nazi Party

Hitler was charming and persuasive

- He was a powerful and confident speaker
- He was good at gauging the mood of the audience and appearing to them as sincere
- He focused his speeches on addressing his audience’s concerns

He was able to win over many important business owners and industrialists

- Many of them agreed with his anti-communist and anti-trade union views
- They contributed to Nazi Party finances

Hitler created a network of local Nazi Parties

The Nazis targeted propaganda and recruitment efforts at rural communities

- Praised them as “true” Aryan Germans
- Attacked the Weimar Republic for not looking after their interests

These efforts yielded results

- Reichstag elections in May 1924: Nazis won 32 seats
- By 1929, the Nazi Party had 100,000 members

## Nazi Party’s Hurdles

- Nazis were less successful in winning support in the towns
    - Most industrial workers supported the SPD or the communists

The Weimar Republic was stable between 1924 - 1929

- Loans and investments from the US had helped stabilize the economy
    - Plenty of jobs
- Government provided generous welfare benefits e.g. old age pensions and housing

In 1928, despite their hard work, the Nazi Party was still a small minority party

- It had support from <3% of the population
- It also did not have much electoral success i.e. gaining seats in the Reichstag
