## Threat to the Republic from the Right Wing (e.g. the Kapp Putsch, 1920)


The German right-wing during the Weimar Republic consisted of people from all classes of society such as:

- Poor workers and farmers
- Wealthy aristocrats
- Former soldiers (including the Freikorps)

**March 1920, Kapp Putsch**

- Wolfgang Kapp led 5,000 Freikorps into Berlin
- He planned to overthrow the Weimar Republic and install a more authoritarian system
- The German army refused to act
- Germanyâ€™s trade unions declared a general strike and civil servants refused to cooperate with Kapp
    - This forced Kapp to give up
    - Kapp was hunted down after he fled the country but died while awaiting trial
    - Besides Kapp, no other rebels were punished.

**Weaknesses**

- The need for the Weimar Republic to rely on the trade unions to stop the Kapp Putsch was a sign of its inability to maintain control of the country on its own. This weakness emboldened and encouraged other groups to challenge its power.
- Right-wing largely escaped punishment and thus continued their political violence.
