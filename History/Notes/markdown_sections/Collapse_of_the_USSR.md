## Collapse of the USSR


- In January 1990, Gorbachev visited the Baltic state of Lithuania, which was part of the USSR.
- Its leaders made clear that they wanted independence.
- Gorbachev was, for once, uncompromising. He would not allow this.
- Nevertheless, in March, Lithuania declared its independence.
- Almost as soon as he returned from Lithuania in 1990, Gorbachev received a similar demand for independence from the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.
    * He responded by sending troops to end rioting there.
    * He also sent troops to Lithuania.
    * But by May-June, the crisis had worsened.
- Reformers within the USSR demanded an end to the Communist Party's domination of government.
- In May, Boris Yeltsin was elected the President of the Russian Republic, the largest republic in the USSR.
    * Yeltsin made it clear that he saw no future for the USSR.
    * He said that the many republics in the USSR should become independent states.
- In July, Ukraine declared its state sovereignty.
- Other republics followed. By the end of 1990, nobody was sure what the USSR meant any longer.
    * Examples
        + In January 1991, events in Lithuania turned to bloodshed as Soviet troops opened fire on protesters.
        + In April, the Republic of Georgia declared its independence.
- In August 1991, hard-liners and leading military officers attempted a coup to take over the USSR.
    * The plotters included Gorbachev's Prime Minister, Pavlov, and the head of the armed forces, Dmitry Yazov.
    * They held Gorbachev prisoner in his holiday home in Crimea.
    * They sent tanks and troops onto the streets.
    * Huge crowds gathered in Moscow.
        + They strongly opposed the military coup, and Yeltsin became the leader of the popular opposition.
    * Faced with this resistance, the plotters lost faith in themselves and the coup collapsed.
- A few days later, Gorbachev returned to Moscow. He might have survived the coup, but he had lost his standing as the Soviet leader.
- He had to admit that the USSR was finished, and he with it.
- In a televised speech on 25 December 1991, Gorbachev announced his resignation as the president of the USSR and the end of the USSR.
    * This event also signalled the end of the cold war.

# Conclusion

- The end of the Cold War has been long debated.
    * Unlike the world wars, the Cold War did not have an official end with a series of peace treaties.
- Some historians make the case that the Cold War ended in 1985 when Gorbachev came to power.
- Some argue it ended with the fall of the Berlin War in November 1989.
- Others put forward that it ended in December 1989, when US President George Bush and Gorbachev met at the Malta Summit and declared the Cold War over.
- However, to many historians, the collapse of the USSR in 1991 signalled the definitive end of the Cold War.
