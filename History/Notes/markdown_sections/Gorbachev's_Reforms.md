## Gorbachev's Reforms


### Introduction


- In 1985, the USSR elected 54 year old Mikhail Gorbachev to be its leader following the death of Konstantin Chernenko, who led the USSR for less than 14 months after succeeding Yuri Andropov in early 1984.
- Gorbachev was aware of the terrible problems facing the USSR:
    * The declining economy
    * The war in Afghanistan
    * The disillusionment of the Soviet people
    * The challenge of the United States under Reagan.
- Despite this, he believed that the USSR could be transformed with new ideas and new thinking.
- He did not intend to dismantle communism in the USSR and Eastern Europe, but he did not want to reform it radically.
- He described his ideas as New Thinking.
    * Gorbachev's New Thinking in domestic policy took the form of two key reforms: __Glasnost ("openness")__ and __Perestroika ("restructuring")__.

### Glasnost


- Gorbachev called for open debate on government policy and honesty in facing up to problems.
- Glasnost was not a detailed set of policies, but it did mean radical change.
    * For example, it would allow open political debate by Communist Party members who disagreed with the government. It would also allow criticism on the government in the media.
- With openness and reforms, the Soviet people were able to learn about the heinous crimes committed by the Soviet Union in the past
    * For example, during the Stalinist years in an exhibition called "Week of Conscience" held in November 1988.
- Unfortunately, Glasnost backfired.
    * It released much resentment against the communist government.
    * Glasnost also exposed the shortcomings of the government officials such as their inefficiency and corruption.
        + This led to decreasing confidence in the party.
    * The Soviets were also further exposed to aspects of the outside world, and especially the better quality of life in the United States and Western European countries, through popular Western culture.
- As a result, the positive picture of Soviet life that the government previously presented to the public quickly fell apart.
    * Many in the Soviet bloc felt deceived and lost confidence in the vision and rule of the communist governments.
    * Hence, instead of rallying the people behind the reforms of "openness", Glasnost had unintentionally created a platform which unleashed criticism of communist rule that eventually brought about the disintegration of the USSR.

### Perestroika


- Perestroika, also known as "restructuring" in Russian, was the series of political and economic reforms which Glasnost was meant to pave the way for. 
- Perestroika involved a range of measures.
    * Managers in companies and industries were encouraged to innovate and try new approaches without first seeking permission from the government. 
    * Managers were also encouraged to involve workers in discussions and decision making about their businesses.
    * In 1987, Perestroika allowed market forces to be introduced into the Soviet economy. 
        + or the first time in 60 years, it was no longer illegal to buy and sell for profit.
- The intent was to encourage new ideas, to increase efficiency and to fight the problem of corruption
- Failure as an economic reform
    * There was no overall increase in output.
    * Instead, there were chronic problems of unemployment, growth of black markets, as well as shortages in basic necessities.
        + This was a result of the conflicting methods of cooperative ownership.
            + Cooperative ownership meant that that private ownership of small businsses was permitted, but the state still retained control over the means of production.
        + This meant that small business owners still had to pay high taxes and deal with dishonest officials.
        + Furthermore, infrastructure, such as roads and storage facilities, for agriculture remained inadequate.
    * The number of unprofitable enterprises that needed government support increased, while many Soviet citizens lost interest in setting up their own businesses.

### Reduction on Military Spending


- Gorbachev was eager to bring his New Thinking to foreign policy and the role of the military in the USSR. He began to cut spending on defence.
- After almost 50 years of massive investment and preparations for war with the United States and its allies, the Red Army began to shrink.
    * Gorbachev was realistic enough to recognise that the USSR could not hope to outspend the United States on nuclear weapons and other military spending.
- At the same time, Gorbachev brought a new attitude to the USSR's relations with the world.
    * In his speeches, he repeatedly talked about international trust and cooperation rather than confrontation as the way forward for the USSR.
- Examples
    * He announced cuts in arms spending.
    * In 1988, he began the final withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
    * In 1990, Gorbachev signed the Treaty of Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) that established comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment in Europe.
        + This allowed the Soviets to reduce the size of its military

### The Reagan-Gorbachev Summits


- In 1983, Reagan wasa shocked to discover that the Soviets had almost launched a nuclear strike against the United States.
    * A malfunction in the Soviets' early warning system made them think the United States had fired missiles at the USSR.
    * Reagan was keen to advance nuclear disarmament and to tamp down the strategic arms race.
- He also observed Gorbachev's reforms with great interest
- These factors led Gorbachev to make overtures to Soviet leaders and to eventually engage Gorbachev in negotiations with a shared commitment to nuclear abolition.
- Between 1985 and 1988, Reagan and Gorbachev had five summit meetings.
    * By the end of these summits they had reached agreements to further reduce their nuclear weapons. 
    * Reagan had also declared that the no longer thought the USSR was an "evil empire" because of the changes Gorbachev was making.

### "De-ideologisation" of Soviet Foreign Policy


- As part of Gorbachev's commitment towards New Thinking at home and abroad, Soviet foreign policy underwent a change known as "de-ideologisation". 
- This meant an end to all ideologically driven engagements designed to promote communism globally and change the United States.
- Gorbachev recognised that in order to successfully reform the Soviet economy, he had to first reduce the large amounts of money being spent overseas in superpower competition with the United States.
- Examples
    * Under Gorbachev, the USSR would also no longer intervene in other countries to support communist regimes or takeovers, as it did under former leaders such as Brezhnev.
        + To demonstrate his commitment towards de-ideologisation, Gorbachev withdrew troops from military engagements in Afghanistan and Angola alongside Soviet support for communist regimes in Cuba and Vietnam.
    * Next, he was prepared to tell the hard-line communist leaders of Eastern Europe that they had to change as well.
        + In 1989, Gorbachev called the leaders of the Warsaw Pact countries together.
            + He explained to them that he was now committed to a policy of non-intervention in the affairs of their countries.
            + He jokingly referred to this policy as the "Sinatra Doctrine."

#### Sinatra Doctrine


- This policy was named after the singer Frank Sinatra, who was famous for the song "My Way."
- In other words, Gorbachev was telling Eastern European states that they could and should go their own way.
- The term was first used by Gorbachev's Foreign Minister, Gennadi Gerasimov.
- In many ways, the policy was already in effect.
    * For example, the Polish government had negotiated with the trade union Solidarity to partially allow free elections in 1989 which could include non-communists in government.
- The policy caused extreme concern among the more hard-line communist leaders.
    * Most of the Warsaw Pact leaders, including East Germany's Erich Honecker and Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu, were traditional, hard-line communists.
    * They completely disagreed with Gorbachev's ideas and were sure that the USSR would not really abandon the communist countries of Eastern Europe
