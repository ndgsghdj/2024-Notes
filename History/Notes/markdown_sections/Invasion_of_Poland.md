## Invasion of Poland


- Hitler’s interest in the Polish Corridor and Danzig was due to…
    - Large German population in the area
    - Desire for a transportation line across the Polish Corridor that separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany
- Since April 1939, Germany had demanded the return of the Polish Corridor and Danzig
    - The Polish leaders rejected these demands
    - They did not trust Hitler and were even concerned about a German invasion
- Negotiations between them broke down
- **On 1 September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland**
    - Hitler was confident the USSR would not oppose him because of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact
    - However, Hitler miscalculated Britain and France’s response
        - On 3 September 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany
            - **World War 2 in Europe had begun**
