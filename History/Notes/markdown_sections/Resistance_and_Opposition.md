    - Grew increasingly concerned by Hitler’s aggressive foreign policy
- Several officers even went as far as to attempt to assassinate Hitler
    - E.g. the failed July 1944 Bomb Plot

### Refusal to Conform


Some simply refused to accept Nazi ideals

- The most common form of resistance
    - E.g. the Gestapo reported a lot of complaining in public spaces

Key groups who resisted the Nazis were…

- Criticism by Churches
    - Germany was a Christian country
        - Most Germans were Protestants and Roman Catholics
    - The Nazis disliked the churches
        - Feared they had too much influence over the people
            - Did not like the idea that people were more loyal to the churches than to him
        - But could not close them down without undermining their own support
    - Early on, Nazis allowed church autonomy
        - In return, churches accepted alignment of Nazi goals
        - Hitler tried to bring the churches under his control
            - Created a new Reich Church with a Nazi bishop in charge
    - Eventually…
        - Promoted alternative religion that glorified Nazis and Hitler
        - Curbed all Christian activities and education
    - In the end, many clergy criticised the Nazis
    - Many clergy ended up in concentration camps
        - E.g. 400 Catholic priests ended up int he clergy block of the Dachau concentration camp
- Anti-Nazi Youth Groups
    - Some youths rejected the Hitler Youth and formed groups that rejected the Nazis
    - E.g.
        - The White Rose
            - Youths attending University of Munich
            - Secretly distributed leaflets revealing Nazi atrocities
            - They were eventually arrested in 1943.
        - The Edelweiss Pirates
            - Made up of working-class teenagers
            - Earliest groups appeared in 1934
                - By 1939, there were ~2,000 members
            - Mocked the Nazis and got in fights with Hitler Youth
            - Nazis persecuted them brutally
                - In 1944, 13 Edelweiss Pirate leaders in Cologne were executed.

# Conclusion

- However, most historians agree that there was limited resistance to Nazi
- This is was a result of a combination of factors based on the Nazi’s economic, social, political policies:
    - The Nazis took control of many segments of society
    - The Nazis gave advantages to supporters
    - Offered Aryan Germans benefits
    - The Nazis ruthlessly persecuted opponents
    - Germans feared the SS and Gestapo
- Many Germans actually disliked the Nazis but respected Hitler
    - They did not blame him for many unpleasant or unfair things that the Nazis did
    - This did not change until the later stages of WW2 by which point the Nazis had already carried out numerous atrocities

| Groups | Beneficials | Not Beneficial |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Communists and other political parties |  | All other political parties were banned. The communists and other political opponents were jailed, executed or driven out of the country.

Control and fear were used to win the support of the people and limit the people’s access to information and ideas. |
| The army | The army’s main rival, the SA was purged in the Night of the Long Knives. Many SA members were absorbed into the army.

Hitler started rearmament and re-introduced conscription after the Army swore allegiance to him, rebuilding the strength of the Army. |  |
| Farmers | The Reich Entailed Farm Law saved many farmers from losing their land to the banks. | However, many farmers remained poor and their farms became state-owned. |
| Middle Class | The crackdown on the communists removed one threat to the middle class

Owners of businesses related to rearmament benefitted from government contracts | Many small business owners continued to struggle. |
| Workers | The Reich Labour Service sent men on public works projects and conservation programmes, reducing unemployment while improving standard of living.

Conscription and rearmament helped to further reduce unemployment, creating jobs in the coal mines, steel and textile mills. | Working and living conditions improved only superficially with new initiatives such as Strength Through Joy and Beauty of Labour |
| Women |  | Women were expected to stay at home and focus on child-rearing. They were excluded from many aspects of life, such as politics, higher education and work. |
