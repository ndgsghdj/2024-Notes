## Background - Korea in the Early 20th Century


- For much of its history, the Korean Peninsula was controlled by neighbouring countries like China and Japan, partly because of its strategic position in East Asia.
    * In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, aggressively extending its control over the region.
        + In 1905, Korea became a protectorate of Japan
        + In 1910, Japan annexed Korea
- The Japanese ruled Korea with an iron fist.
    * The police and military had total power and Koreans had very few rights.
    * Not surprisingly, there was a great deal of resentment towards the Japanese.
    * Though it was difficult and dangerous to oppose Japanese rule, some Koreans resisted.
    * Despite crushing resistance movements brutally, the Japanese continued to fight against them through the 1920s and 1930s. Still, it proved impossible to undermine Japanese control of Korea.
- Resistance to Japanese rule intensified with the outbreak of WWII.
    * Some of the resistance movements had the support of communists in China and the USSR.
    * The resistance groups were courageous and committed,b ut still failed to make much of an impact on Japanese rule.
        + With differing aims and ambitions for an independent Korea, the different groups were deeply divided.

### Example


- One resistance group, led by Kim il Sung, was particularly important. Kim was a deeply committed communist who had been trained in political and military thinking in the USSR. His forces fought a tenacious guerilla war against the Japanese until they were forced to flee to communist-controlled areas in China in 1939.
    * This struggle proved to be important later as it helped Kim gain the support of the North Koreans after the war.
