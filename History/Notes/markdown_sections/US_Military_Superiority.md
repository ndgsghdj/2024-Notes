## US Military Superiority


### Examples and Explanation


The US continued developing an ever-growing military superiority over the Soviet Union. For example, in 1982, he gave the go-ahead for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), popularly known as the "Star Wars" programme. This was a multi-billion-dollar project to create a system that could use satellites and lasers to destroy missiles before they hit their targets. Such a system could change the nature of nuclear war. Whilst the SDI did not develop into a viable weapon, it succeeded in putting pressure on the Soviets, who were never sure whether the weapon would become a reality. By this time, the USSR was already finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with the United States, given its stretched resources. Thus, renewed arms spending to counter the SDI would ruin it.

Faced with this fact and the overwhelming military advantage that the potential of the SDI might have, the Soviets were encouraged to attempt to de-escalate the tensions underpinning the Cold War, thus contributing to its end.
