## Strengths of the Allies


### Importance of the United States - Economic and Military Strengths of the United States (Europe and the Asia-Pacific)


#### Example and Explanation

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States’ vast resources were mobilised within a short time. Its people, factories, shipyards, farms and even Hollywood and the movie industry joined in the war effort. For example, by 1944, the United States was producing almost half of the weapons being made globally – more than twice the production of Germany and Japan combined. In total, between 1941 and 1945, US factories produced 250,000 aircraft, 90,000 tanks, 350 naval destroyers, 200 submarines and 5,600 merchant ships.

#### Link

This massive production derived from American economic strength translated into military strength as it supplied it and the other Allied powers with a vast amount of military equipment and other resources essential for the war effort. Resources that the Axis powers simply could not match, thus giving the Allies a overwhelming advantage that allowed them to win the war

### Importance of the United States - Battle of the Atlantic (Europe)


#### Example and Explanation

Control of the Atlantic was vital to the Allied war effort as it was only control of the shipping routes across the Atlantic that vital American supplies could shipped to to Britain and to the USSR. This control was only achieved through a bitter struggle and at a high cost by the Allies. German submarines (U-boats) were very effective early in the Battle of the Atlantic. In 1940, the Germans sank over 1,000 ships, a quarter of Britain’s merchant fleet. In 1941, 1,300 Allied ships were lost, and in 1942, 1,661 ships. As a result, in January 1943, the British navy had only two months’ supply of oil left. The tide began to turn through 1943. British intelligence was able to break the secret codes used by the U-boats. This allowed the Allied convoys to steer clear of the U-boats, hence ensuring Britain and the USSR had the resources to fend off the Axis powers. New weapons and tactics were also developed to counter the U-boats.

#### Link

This victory allowed the much needed American supplies to reach Britain and to the USSR, allowing them to continue the fight against the Axis that would ultimately conclude in an Allied victory in World War 2.

### Importance of the United States - Island-Hopping Strategy in the Asia-Pacific (The Asia-Pacific)


#### Example and Explanation

To avoid a potentially lengthy and costly campaign against the Japanese forces which had dug themselves into island strongholds across the vast empire they had built from 1937-1941, the Allies came up with the strategy of island-hopping.  It involved using air attacks and submarines to isolate Japanese-held areas, instead of trying to capture them. The Allies would then conquer the islands, which were poorly defended, and use them to further cut off ships that supplied the well-defended islands. The idea was to cut off some areas from their supplies of food, ammunition and other essentials.

#### Link

This approach proved to be successful. It allowed the Allies to incur fewer casualties and come within striking distance of Japan itself in just a few years. It thus contributed to Allied victory in World War 2.

### Importance of the United States - Use of the Atomic Bomb (The Asia-Pacific)


#### Example and Explanation

Faced with the strong resistance of the Japanese forces, the United States decided to use its newly developed atomic bombs without warning. On 6 August 1945, the American bomber, Enola Gay, dropped a five-ton atomic bomb, nicknamed “Little Boy”, over the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Following this, on 9 August, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb, nicknamed “Fat Man”, over the city of Nagasaki. In total, the two atomic bombings killed more than 100,000 people and injured another 100,000.

#### Link

The devastation brought about by the two atomic bombs was one of the key reasons for Japan’s surrender, securing Allied victory in World War 2.

### Importance of Britain - British resistance to German invasion (Europe)


### Example and Explanation

A key factor in the defeat of the Axis powers was Britain’s ability to resist the German invasion in 1940–1941. During the Battle of Britain, Britain’s Royal Air Force (RAF) had excellent fighter aircraft such as the Supermarine Spitfire, and the Hawker Hurricane British aircraft were as good as the Germans’. Additionally, the factories were able to keep producing more of such aircraft to replace their losses. Moreover, the British had the new technology of radar which could be used to detect and locate incoming enemy aircraft. Fighting over home ground also gave the British the advantage of tapping large reserves of spare parts for repair work and using less fuel for its war production.

#### Link

Thanks to these advantages, the British were able to win the Battle of Britain and prevent a German invasion of their country. This allowed Britain to become a substantial military base for the Allies. A base that made the D-Day landings of 1944 and the Allied bombing campaigns against Germany possible. Campaigns that ultimately led to the defeat of Germany.

### Importance of Britain - British resistance to the Japanese (The Asia Pacific)


#### Example and Explanation

The British Empire was a major source of the manpower and resources that opposed the Japanese in the Asia‑Pacific. The armies and navies of Britain, Australia, New Zealand and around 120,000 African troops from British colonies fought alongside US troops against the Japanese. The British Empire forces also included the immense manpower and resources of India. India provided over 2.5 million men and women and a staggering 80 percent of its wealth to the Allied war effort. Although Indian troops fought in North Africa and Europe as well, the majority fought in Asia against the Japanese.

#### Link

Thus the British represented a major component of the manpower and resources opposed to the Japanese in the Asia-Pacific. They thus played a vital part in the effort to defeat the Japanese and securing an Allied victory in World War 2.

### Importance of the USSR - Reorganisation and resistance (Europe)


#### Example and Explanation (Reorganisation)


When the German advance was halted by the Russian winter in late 1941, Stalin and his military leaders used this time to reform the Red Army completely. They copied many of the tactics and ideas used by the Germans and added some of their own. For example, the Red Army created specialist tank armies and air forces. At the same time, harsh discipline was enforced, such as, Order 227 of July 1942 which ordered the Soviet Army to fight and die for every bit of Russian soil.

#### Link (Reorganisation)


By taking such steps to reorganize the Red Army, the USSR was able to improve its ability to fight the Germans. An ability that ultimately allowed them to turn the tide and not only push the invaders out of their country but to launch a counterattack that saw them invading and occupying parts of Germany itself, securing victory in World War 2.

#### Example and Explanation (Resistance)


The Soviet Union suffered heavy losses in the early phases of the German invasion. However, it nevertheless continued to fiercely resist. The Germans had advanced again in 1942 towards the city of Stalingrad. Here, the Soviets held them in a fierce battle and, despite suffering heavy casualties, were eventually able to encircle the Germans, forcing them to surrender.

#### Link (Resistance)


This victory raised the morale of the Soviets as they began to drive the Germans back. A counterattack that led to them not only pushing the invaders out of their country but invading and occupying parts of Germany itself, securing victory in World War 2..

### Importance of the USSR - Resources and Production: The Soviet War Economy (Europe)


#### Example and Explanation (Measures taken by the USSR)


To ensure production kept up with the high demand needed by the Red Army in its fight against the Germans, the Soviets enacted harsh measures. For example, adults in the USSR received no food unless they worked in some way for the war effort. This applied to men and women – half of the Soviet workforce was female.  Forced labour was also used and the secret police kept close control of the population.

#### Link (Measures taken by the USSR)


These measures allowed the Soviet Red Army to not only continue to oppose the invading Germans but also steadily grow in strength. Strength that ultimately allowed it to turn the tide and not only push the invaders out of the Soviet Union but to launch a counterattack that saw them invading and occupying parts of Germany itself, securing victory in World War 2.

#### Example and Explanation (Role of the USSR's allies)


The USSR's allies also made important contributions to the campaign. Britain and the United States supplied vast amounts of food, raw materials and industrial equipment via shipping routes despite the U-boat threat from Germany. The United States provided the USSR with over 500,000 motor vehicles and 1,900 locomotives and half of its supply of rubber tyres and copper.

#### Link (Role of the USSR's allies)


This aid allowed the Soviet Red Army to not only continue to oppose the invading Germans but also steadily grow in strength. Strength that ultimately allowed it to turn the tide and not only push the invaders out of the Soviet Union but to launch a counterattack that saw them invading and occupying parts of Germany itself, securing victory in WW2.

### Importance of the USSR - Entry to the Asia-Pacific (The Asia Pacific)


#### Example and Explanation

As agreed at the Tehran Conference and Yalta Conference, the USSR entered the war against Japan three months after the defeat of Germany. Despite being part of the Allied forces, the USSR did not take part in the war against Japan in the Asia-Pacific until 1945. This was because Japan and the USSR had signed the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact in 1941 which was to be upheld for five years. On 8 August 1945, the Soviets declared war against Japan and launched their invasion simultaneously on three fronts of Manchuria.

#### Link

The Soviets were able to defeat the Kwantung Army in Manchuria and occupy northern Korea, which contributed to Japan’s decision to surrender to the Allied forces.
