## North Vietnam in the 1950s


- __Immediately after the Geneva Conference__, Ho worked quickly to consoildate his hold on North Vietnam.
    * In the early months of the regime, thousands fled from North Vietnam in fear of communist rule.
    * At the same time, many Viet Minh soldiers and supporters in South Vietnam fled northwards.
        + This strengthened the regime as it got rid of potential opponents.
- Ho and the communists had much support in North Vietnam for two reasons:
    * Ho was recognised as a great leader who had fought the Japanese invaders and the French colonial rulers.
    * Sweeping land reforms were introduced which ensured that land was confiscated from larger landowners and redistributed to the peasant farmers.
        + During this redistribution policy, manhy landlords were placed on show trials.
            + Show trials - a public trial of a political offender where there are no proper legal processes. Often, the objective is to make an example of the offender rather than ensuring justice.
