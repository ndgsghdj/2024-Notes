## The Night of the Long Knives


- By 1934, Hitler began to see the SA, particularly its leader, Ernst Röhm, as a threat
    - Röhm was an ally of Hitler
        - Hitler had asked him to lead SA in 1930
    - But by 1933, there was growing tension between them
        - Not given an important role in the new government
- Sources of tension
    - SA was ~3 million strong
        - All of whom were fiercely loyal to Rohm
            - They supported his calls to tax industrialists and landowners to help the unemployed
            - However, these very groups helped Hitler come to power
                - (awkward)
    - Army commanders also suspicious of Rohm
        - They thought the SA was a disreputable force (aka thugs)
        - Unsettled by Rohm’s talk of making the SA into a second German army
- On the weekend of 29-30 June 1934 (the main event)
    - Hitler called the leaders of the SA to a special conference
    - Squads of SS men arrested Rohm and other SA leaders both at the conference and throughout Germany
        - Hitler accused Rohm of plotting to overthrow and murder him
        - Rohm and ~400 were executed.
    - Hitler also targeted his old rivals
        - E.g. von Papen is placed under house arrest
            - Hitler offers him a post as an ambassador to Austria and he accepts, probably a decision that saved his life
- Aftermath
    - No public protests - this demonstrated Hitler’s power and the people’s fear
    - SA was disbanded shortly afterwards
    - Many of its members were absorbed into the army and SS
