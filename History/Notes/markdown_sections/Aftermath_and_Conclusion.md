## Aftermath and Conclusion


### Communist Victory


- With the withdrawal of the United states and the surrender of the South Vietnamese government, North Vietnamese forces declared victory in Saigon, which was subsequently renamed to Ho Chi Minh City.
- Finally, after 30 years of constant conflict, the struggle for control of Vietnam had been settled.
    * The __communists had won__, and Vietnam reunified as a communist state.
- After seizing power:
    * The communist government in Vietnam also sought to establish an iron-fisted rule.
        + They rounded up hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese and put them in supposed "re-education camps".
            + These camps were, in reality, prison camps where former supporters and collaborators of the South Vietnamese government were subjected to indoctrination, torture and forced labour.
    * In 1976, Vietnam became known as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, under the leadership of Communist Party Chairman Le Duan.
        + The communist state aligned itself closely with the USSR, from which it continued to receive aid in order to secure and control the new nation.

### The Cost to Vietnam


- An estimated over two million Vietnamese perished in the war, and another three million were wounded.
- The use of chemical weapons by the United States also created health problems for subsequent generations of Vietnamese
- The defeat of South Vietnam also triggered a refugee crisis in 1975, in which an estimated 800,000 Vietnamese fled Vietnam by small boats.
    * These refugees braved hunger, disease and pirates at sea in order to reach the safety of neighbouring countries.
