## US Military Superiority: Expanding US Might


- The booming economy gave Reagan and his allies the confidence and the money to champion US values of capitalism and democracy.
- Reagan believed in taking a tough line with the USSR wherever possible and increasing US defence spending.
- Examples
    * He supported anti-communist forces in Afghanistan and Nicaragua
    * He increased the US defence budget massively.
        + In his first two weeks in office, he increased the defence budget by $32.6 billion.
        + New weapons systems such as the B1 nuclear bomber were introduced.
        + This huge spending left the United States with $4 trillion of debt by the 1980s.
- In 1982, he gave the go-ahead for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, popularly known as the "Star Wars" programme).
    * This was a multi-billion dollar project to create a system that could use satellites and lasers to destroy missiles before they hit their targets.
    * Clearly, such a system could change the nature of war.
    * The SDI did not develop into a viable weapon
    * However, it put pressure on the Soviets, who were never sure whether the weapon would become a reality.
        + The USSR was already finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with the United States, given its stretched. Renewed arms spending would ruin it.
