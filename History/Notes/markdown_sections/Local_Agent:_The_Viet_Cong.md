## Local Agent: The Viet Cong


- In the early 1960s, supplied by North Vietnam, the Viet Cong stepped up the guerilla war against the South Vietnamese government.
- E.g. Using the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the Viet Cong sent reinforcements and supplies to guerilla fighters, including around 40,000 North Vietnamese Army troops between 1961 and 1963.
    * The fighters attacked South Vietnamese government forces, officials and buildings.
- Furthermore, the Viet Cong often chose to avoid well-defended South Vietnamese positions in urban areas, but instead focused on making the countryside unsafe for government forces.
- They also attacked the US Air Force supply bases.
