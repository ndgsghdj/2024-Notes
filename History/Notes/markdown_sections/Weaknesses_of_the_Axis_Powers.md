## Weaknesses of the Axis Powers


### Germany’s Military Weaknesses - Hitler’s Mistakes (Europe)


#### Example and Explanation

The Germans made several critical errors in their campaigns, largely due to an inefficient command structure. German commanders constantly had to report back to Hitler, who regularly intervened in military decisions. One example of such is his declaration of war on the United States. Hitler erroneously decided to declare war on the United States four days after the Pearl Harbor attack, despite having no obligation to do so under the terms of the Tripartite Pact signed with Japan and Italy. This move essentially brought the United States, which had been neutral, into the European theatre of war. Germany would now have to contend with the immense amount of resources and military might brought about by the United States, one of the most industrialised countries in the world.

#### Link

While Hitler may have been a shrewd politician, he had never been a senior military commander. He had little military command experience at the highest level. Thus, the mistakes he made as a result of this inexperience contributed to the Axis defeat in World War 2.

### Germany’s Military Weaknesses - The Two-Front War (Europe)


#### Example and Explanation

In WWI, Germany had tried to avoid a war on two fronts – against Russia in the east and against Britain and France in the west. In 1940, Hitler successfully fought a single-front war against Britain and France, but he failed to defeat Britain. When he invaded the USSR in 1941, he placed Germany in a two-front war. This prevented him from concentrating his efforts and resources on a single front. It could even be argued that Germany was fighting on three fronts if we consider the Allied bombing campaign. Besides, Germany was not just facing Britain on the Western Front, but the United States for most of the war.

#### Link

Thus by allowing the war to become a two-front war, the Germans put themselves in the position of being gradually worn down by the Allied forces. This strongly contributed to the Allied victory in World War 2.

### Germany’s Military Weaknesses - Poor Planning (Europe)


#### Explanation and Link (Naval Warfare)

Germany suffered from poor planning in regards to its navy. While the Germans’ use of U-boats was highly effective, their use of surface ships was less so.They put too many resources into building giant battleships, such as Bismarck and Tirpitz, and failed to build aircraft carriers.

#### Link (Naval Warfare)

These weaknesses in its navy led Germany to defeat and the Battle of the Atlantic, which meant it was unable to cut off Britain and the Soviet Union from the vital supply of American resources shipped across the ocean. This failure ultimately contributed to its defeat in World War 2.

#### Explanation and Link (Air Power)

Germany suffered from poor planning in regards to its air force. From 1942 to 1945, the RAF and the US Air Force bombed Germany relentlessly. The Germans never developed heavy bombers like the RAF’s Lancaster or the US’ B-17, which could do severe damage to towns and cities. German bombers were too small and could not carry enough bombs. Also, in the Battle of Britain, the RAF had the advantage of radar, which the Germans had not invested in. The RAF also had plenty of fuel, ammunition and spare parts. On the other hand, shortages in these resources plagued the Luftwaffe.

#### Link (Air Power)

These weaknesses in its air force put it a major disadvantage against the Allies that it could not overcome, ultimately contributed to its defeat in World War 2.

### Japan’s Military Weaknesses - Inter-Service Rivalry (The Asia-Pacific)


#### Example and Explanation

The Japanese army and navy had a long-term conflict with each other since the Meiji period.
In the 1930s, both services of the Japanese military had different strategic goals and ideas for how they wanted to seize territories to obtain resources to sustain Japan’s economy.
When the war broke out, the rivalry between the army and navy prevented both groups from sharing resources and exchanging military intelligence, much less coordinate their attacks and defences against the Allies. For example, in 1942, when the navy asked the army to provide troop support for an invasion of Australia, the army refused. Furthermore, the army remained unresponsive throughout the Pacific War and was late to recognise the threat of the US counteroffensive in late 1942.

#### Link

This rivalry prevented the Japanese from making the best use of its resources, putting it a disadvantage and thus contributing to their defeat by the Allies.

### Japan’s Military Weaknesses - Overstretched Empire (The Asia-Pacific)


#### Example and Explanation

The Japanese were unable to effectively leverage the empire they had expanded from 1931 to 1941. The Japanese empire was very spread out. In many areas, rail and road communications were poor, so it was difficult to deliver raw materials and workers efficiently to the places where they were needed.

#### Link

This inability to effectively allocate its resources due to its size meant that the Japanese empire was a disadvantage and thus contributing to its defeat by the Allies.

### Japan’s Military Weaknesses - Poor Planning (The Asia-Pacific)

#### Example and Explanation

The Japanese failed to understand that the war at sea had changed by 1941. Air power, in the form of aircraft based on carriers, was now far more important than traditional naval power like battleships. Therefore, while the Japanese damaged US battleships during the attack on Pearl Harbor, they did not destroy any US aircraft carriers, as they were not located at the base. This outcome allowed the US Navy to recover from the attack quickly.

#### Link

This failure to recognize that the nature of naval warfare had changed and adapt to a focus on carrier based combat meant that the Japanese empire was a disadvantage and thus contributing to its defeat by the Allies.

### Japan’s Military Weaknesses - Lack of Local Support (The Asia-Pacific)


#### Examples and Explanation

The Japanese were unable to make the best use of their empire because of how brutally they had treated the peoples they conquered. They looted the resources of the conquered lands. They also abused the locals and forced thousands into slave labour. This resulted in millions of civilian deaths  under Japanese rule. As a result, the conquered peoples began to resist in any way they could against the Japanese. For example, in Vietnam, the nationalist leader Ho Chi Minh led the Viet Minh in a guerrilla campaign which gradually wore down the Japanese.

#### Link

This lack of local support within its empire meant that the Japanese could not effectively extract the resources it needed from its the territory it controlled. That said lack of support also often led to outright resistance also drained Japanese military forces as they would be required to be redeployed to suppress such forces. This thus caused the Japanese Japanese empire was put at a disadvantage and contributed to its defeat by the Allies.
