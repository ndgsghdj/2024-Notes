## Economic Recovery - Unemployment


- Reorganised German finances to facilitate a huge work creation programme
    - The **Reich Labour Service** sent men on public works projects and conservation programmes
    - E.g.
        - Built a network of autobahns (highways)
        - Built/extended railways
        - Worked in major house-building programmes
        - Built new public buildings e.g. the Reich Chancellery
    - Impact: These measures were **effective** and unemployment **declined.**
