## **The Attack on Pearl Harbor**


### Rationale


- Even with the increased output of Manchuria, Korea and all its other territories, Japan could not challenge the power of the United States outright.
- In September 1940, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact, which made it an ally of Germany and Italy.
    - The pact was meant to be insurance against US intervention.
- The Japanese commanders also decided that they needed to deliver a quick knockout blow to the United States from which the latter would take time to recover.
    - In that time, Japan would be able to conquer new territories, build up its economic resources and match US power.
- Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku devised a preemptive strike against the United States. The strategy targeted the powerful US Pacific Fleet base at Pearl Harbor which protected US and other Western interests in Asia.
    - This would destroy the US Pacific Fleet so that Japan could keep control of the Pacific without US interference.

### The Attack


On the morning of 7 December 1941, some 300 planes took off from Japanese aircraft carriers to launch their attack on Pearl Harbor.

### Aftermath


- While the attack caused widespread destruction, Japan failed to destroy…
    - American repair shops
    - Fuel-oil tanks
    - Other crucial naval installations.
    - All three of the US Pacific Fleet’s aircraft carriers
        - They were not present at Pearl Harbor.
- Furthermore, with this attack, the United States declared war on Japan triggering the outbreak of World War II in Asia-Pacific.
    - President Roosevelt called 7 December 1941 “a date which [would] live in infamy”.
- The Pearl Harbor attack severely crippled US naval and air strength in the region, allowing Japan to continue its expansion to the rest of Southeast Asia.
- By 1942, Japan controlled most of Southeast Asia, including Indochina, Indonesia, Malaya, Singapore and the Philippines.
- But the fall of Pearl Harbor was not the knockout punch that Japan had intended.
    - The day after the attack, the US Congress declared war on Japan.
    - The United States recovered rapidly from the setback in 1941.
