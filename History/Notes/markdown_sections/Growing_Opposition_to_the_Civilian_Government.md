## Growing Opposition to the Civilian Government


- By the 1930s, a network of ultranationalistic and anti-democratic activists began to form and grow
    * Included junior military oficers
    * Likely had secret backing of senior military commanders
    * They were against civilian political leaders and the zaibatsu, who they saw as self-serving
- Examples

        + Sought to remove all aspects of the democratic government
        + Restore direct rule of the Emperor
    * Sakurakai (Cherry Blossom Society)

    * All shared opposition to democracy

### Showa Restoration

#### Assassinations in 1930s Japan


__November 1930__

- A right wing fanatic that Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi

__February 1932__

- The League of Blood murdered the former Finance Minister

__March 1932__

- The League of Blood assassinated the head of the Mitsui Corporation

__May 1932__

The assassinations intimidated the civilian politicians
- They dropped opposition to the military

Created a sense of instability
- Military exploited this atmosphere to give the impression that they were the only force that could "restore order"

Things that came to a head in 1932 with the 1932 with the May 15 Incident.

### May 15 Incident, 1932


- On 15 May, 1932, a group of naval officers from the League of Blood and other activists assassinated PM Inukai Tsuyoshi 
    * Inukai had angered extremists by:
        + Opposing the actions of the military in Manchuria
        + Refusing to give official government acceptance of Manchukuo when it was announced in February 1932.
    * On the same day of hte assassination, the attackers also attacked:
        + Mitsubishi Bank
        + The Seiyukai HQ
        + Several power stations
        + Other government officials
    * It was an attempted coup d'etat
        + The attackers had hoped that the people would rise up and support them in their attempt to overthrow the democratic government
        + However, the people did not rise up
    * Aftermath
        + The League of Blood activists were arrested and put on trial
            + However, the military commanders:
                + Did not condemn the rebellion
                + They issued a statement that accused the officers for their actions and demanded political reform.
        + Although the military did not spell it out, they were declaring that they wanted control of the government
        + In response, talks were carried out with military leaders
            + The Seiyukai party was prevented from forming a new Cabinet despite having a majority of representatives in the Diet
        + On 26 May 1932, the Emperor appointed a navy admiral as Japan's new PM.
            + His Cabinet had 15 members
                + Only 5 were elected civilian party representatives
                + The remaining 10 were military officers and government officials
                + This effectively brought Japan under militarist rule.
