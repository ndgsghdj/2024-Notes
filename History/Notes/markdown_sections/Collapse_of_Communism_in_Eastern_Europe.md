## Collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe


- In July 1988, Gorbachev made a speech at the Warsaw Pact summit stating his intention to withdraw large numbers of Soviet troops, tanks and aircraft from other communist states.
    * He reinforced these intentions in a speech to the Polish parliament soon after.
- In March 1989, Gorbachev made clear to the Warsaw Pact leaders that the Soviet army would leave Eastern Europe and no longer prop their countries up.
    * They would have to listen to their people.
- In the months that followed, there was a sudden and dramatic collapse of communism across Eastern Europe.
