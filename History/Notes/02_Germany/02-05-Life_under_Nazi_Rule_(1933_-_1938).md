# Life under Nazi Rule (1933 - 1938)

# Nazi Economic Policies

## Economic Recovery - Germany’s Finances

- In 1933…
    - Worst of the Great Depression had passed
    - ~5 million unemployed

**The Nazis acted with energy and commitment**

- Organised Germany finances
- In March 1933, Hitler appointed Hjalmar Schacht as president of the Reichsbank
    - In August ‘34, he became Economics Minister
- Under him…
    - Germany engaged in deficit financing i.e. borrowing from the public through loans
- Impact: This stabilised German finances and provided funds for other programmes

## Economic Recovery - Unemployment

- Reorganised German finances to facilitate a huge work creation programme
    - The **Reich Labour Service** sent men on public works projects and conservation programmes
    - E.g.
        - Built a network of autobahns (highways)
        - Built/extended railways
        - Worked in major house-building programmes
        - Built new public buildings e.g. the Reich Chancellery
    - Impact: These measures were **effective** and unemployment **declined.**

## Rearmament and the Move to a War Economy

- 1935: Reintroduction of conscription
- 1936: Four-year plan under Goering
    - Ready Germany for war in 4 years
    - Priority give to rearmament and **autarky**

<aside>
💡 **Autarky -** Germany to be in self-sufficient as possible in terms of food and industrial production

</aside>

- Economy to be managed through regulations controlling most aspects of labour, prices and raw materials
    - E.g. industries had to meet targets.
- **Impact**
    - Conscription and rearmament created jobs
        - E.g.
            - Conscription gave the unemployed jobs as soldiers
            - Rearmament led to an expansion of industry which created jobs
            - Luffwaffe (new German air force) provided opportunities for engineers and designers
    - Boosted Hitler’s popularity by renewing German national pride
        - Germans felt they were finally escaping the humiliation of WW1 and ToV
        - They were a great power again.

## Living Standards in Nazi Germany

- Big businesses benefitted
    - No longer had to worry about trade unions and strikes
    - Companies like Siemens, Mercedes and Volkswagen made massive profits due to government contracts
    - As a result, managers’ income rose
        - This rise was much faster than the average worker
- Farmers remained poor
    - During the Great Depression, many farmers took loans from banks to survive
    - The Nazis introduced the **Reich Entailed Farm Law** which prevented banks from taking the lands of indebted farmers
    - However, this just meant that the state took on the debt and ownership of the land
- Middle classes saw a mixed picture
    - Many were pleased at the crushing of the communists
    - Owners of businesses connected to rearmament benefitted from government contracts
    - Owners of small businesses continued to struggle
    - **Impact**
        - Whether one’s living standards improved or declined under Nazi rule depended on which class you belonged to.

## Working Conditions in Nazi Germany

Lower unemployment brought about by Nazi policies

- Boosted their support among workers

**Propaganda**

- Praised workers
- Associated Hitler with them e.g. calling him Germany’s “First Worker”

**Other measures also sought to win their loyalty**

- **Strength Through Joy (Kraft durch Freude / kdF)**
    - Gave workers cheap theatre and cinema tickets
    - Organised events e.g. courses, trips, sports
    - Offered discounted cruises on luxury liners
    - By 1939, >50 million Germans had been on a KdF holiday
- **Beauty of Labour (Schonheit der Arbeit)**
    - Improved working conditions
        - Introduced washing facilities and low-cost canteens
    - **Programme to help workers buy a Volkswagen Beetle**
        - Became symbolic of a prosperous new Germany
        - But no worker ever received one by 1939 when the war ended all car production

### Impact

Workers lost…

- Their main political party i.e. the SDP
- Their trade unions
- Bred resentment

All workers had to join the German Labour Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront/DAF) which…

- Prevented strikes for better pay and conditions

Wages remained comparatively low

- Though prices of goods were also kept low

**By the late 1930s, many workers’ living standards were still lower than before the Great Depression**

# Nazi Social Policies

## Role of Women in Nazi Germany

### In the Weimar Republic, women…

- Had the right to vote
- Equal in areas of marriage and civic matters

### Hitler’s Beliefs of Women’s Roles

Hitler believed a woman’s role is:

- To be a good mother
- To look after children
- To marry young
- To stay at home while the husband works
- To produce as many babies as possible

To force women to adhere to this belief, the Nazi regime…

- Introduced policies that excluded women from politics and academics
    - Women were not allowed to vote
    - They were discouraged from pursuing university studies.
- Funneled girls into the **League of German Girls (Bund Deutscher Madel/BDM)** where they received vigorous training in domestic tasks
- Introduced policies that limited employment opportunities for women
    - E.g. discrimination against women applicants for jobs was encouraged
- Pushed his beliefs via mass media - posters, radio broadcasts, news <nitb>
- In order to boost population, incentives were given <nitb>:
    - 1933 - Law for the Encouragement of Marriage (provided 1000 marks loan for newly married couples)
    - August 12th - Motherhood Cross

### Reaction of German Women

Most women actually agreed with Hitler’s views even though it meant that women’s rights were restricted. E.g.

- Women employed as teachers, lawyers, doctors and civil servants were sacked
- Married women coudl not wear make-up / trousers
- No dyeing of hair color / perms
- Wear flat shoes
- No slimming/dieting - bad for child birth
- No smoking - un-German behaviour

### Impact

- Boost in birth rate and pregnancies outside marriage
- During WW2…
    - Roles of women had to change, despite Nazi reluctance
    - Female workers employed in arms industries because the supply of unemployed men needed for factory work had dried up
    - However, stereotype of women’s role was mostly maintained e.g. no German women allowed in the armed forces

## Youth - Education and the Hitler Youth

- Hitler was especially keen to win over the minds of young people

            - Germans belonged to Aryans race
            - Other races were sub-human
    - A sample from Nazi Math textbook <nitb>:
        - “The Jews are aliens in Germany. In 1933, there were 66,060,000 citizens in German Reich. 499,862 were Jews. What was the % of aliens in Germany?”
- In addition to the school system, German youths were indoctrinated with Nazi ideology through Hitler Youth movements
    - Hitler Youth - a paramilitary organisation of the Nazi Party that groomed German youths to be future Nazi leaders

            - Older boys did a lot of physical exercises to prepare for military service in the German Army
        - All of which was backed up by indoctrination in anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology

### Impact

- Inspired in many German youths…
    - Complete loyalty to Hitler and the Nazis
    - Alienation from parents to a certain extent
- A minority anti-Hitler group developed

## Persecution of Minorities

Anyone not belonging to the Aryan race were persecuted

- They persecuted members of other races and minority groups (e.g. Roma/gypsies), homosexuals and the mentally ill

They also persecuted any group thought to be a challenge to Nazi ideas

E.g.

- 1/3 of Roma in Germany in 1939 were killed

They further sought to ‘improve’ the Aryan race through eugenics and euthanasia

- Over 300,000 men and women were sterilised between 1934 and 1935.

## Hitler and the Jews

Hitler hated the Jews

- In his years of poverty in Vienna before WW1, he obsessed over the fact that Jews ran many of the most successful businesses
- He blamed Jewish businessmen and bankers for Germany’s defeat in WW1
    - He believed they forced the German surrender

Once in power, the Nazis began a campaign of anti-semitic persecution

- Many forced out of their jobs
    - They were banned from civil service and a variety of public services (e.g. teaching, broadcasting)
    - As the government took control of the legal and journalistic professions and universities, where many Jews worked, they lost their jobs
- Many Jews also owned small businesses
    - Lost contracts
    - Businesses closed due to intimidation
- Nazi propaganda bombarded Germans with anti-Jewish messages
- Segregation was encouraged
    - In schools, Jewish children were segregated and humiliated
    - Many shops hung “Jews Not Welcome” signs
- SS and SA targeted Jews
    - Jews were arrested and beaten up
    - Jewish shops had slogans painted over their windows (e.g. marked with the Star of David)

- Passed in 1935
- Jews were stripped of their German citizenship
- Forbidden to marry pure-blooded Germans

**Kristallnacht/ the Night of Broken Glass**

- In November 1938, a young Jew killed a German diplomat in Paris
- In response, the Nazis proceeded to launch Kristallnacht
    - Plain-clothed SS are given the addresses of Jewish businesses
        - They smashed them up
    - 91 Jews murdered
    - 100s of synagogues burned
    - 20,000 Jews were taken to concentration camps
    - 1000s more left Germany
- Nazi-controlled media painted it as a spontaneous reaction of ordinary Germans against Jews
    - Most Germans did not believe this
- Many Germans were alarmed and concerned
    - But hardly anyone protested
    - The few who did were brutally murdered

**The Final Solution**

- Germany was very successful in the early stages of WW2
    - They captured large areas of Eastern Europe
    - Many Jews lived in these areas
- From 1941 onwards, Jews were subjected to the Final Solution to the Jewish Question
    - Used as slave labour
    - Forced to live in ghettos
    - Systematically killed in death camps
    - **~6 million Jews killed by 1945**
- Historians generally agree that Hitler and SS were responsible for the death camps, though others were responsible too
    - E.g.
        - The genocide would not have been possible without cooperation of the German civil service and police in Germany and occupied lands
        - Others (the German army, major industry leaders and managers) either cooperated with or did nothing to stop the genocide
        - Many historians also believe the German people as a whole also holds some responsibility

    - The Nazis took control of many segments of society
    - The Nazis gave advantages to supporters
    - Offered Aryan Germans benefits
    - The Nazis ruthlessly persecuted opponents
    - Germans feared the SS and Gestapo
- Many Germans actually disliked the Nazis but respected Hitler
    - They did not blame him for many unpleasant or unfair things that the Nazis did
    - This did not change until the later stages of WW2 by which point the Nazis had already carried out numerous atrocities

| Groups | Beneficials | Not Beneficial |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Communists and other political parties |  | All other political parties were banned. The communists and other political opponents were jailed, executed or driven out of the country.

Control and fear were used to win the support of the people and limit the people’s access to information and ideas. |
| The army | The army’s main rival, the SA was purged in the Night of the Long Knives. Many SA members were absorbed into the army.

Hitler started rearmament and re-introduced conscription after the Army swore allegiance to him, rebuilding the strength of the Army. |  |
| Farmers | The Reich Entailed Farm Law saved many farmers from losing their land to the banks. | However, many farmers remained poor and their farms became state-owned. |
| Middle Class | The crackdown on the communists removed one threat to the middle class

Owners of businesses related to rearmament benefitted from government contracts | Many small business owners continued to struggle. |
| Workers | The Reich Labour Service sent men on public works projects and conservation programmes, reducing unemployment while improving standard of living.

Conscription and rearmament helped to further reduce unemployment, creating jobs in the coal mines, steel and textile mills. | Working and living conditions improved only superficially with new initiatives such as Strength Through Joy and Beauty of Labour |
| Women |  | Women were expected to stay at home and focus on child-rearing. They were excluded from many aspects of life, such as politics, higher education and work. |
