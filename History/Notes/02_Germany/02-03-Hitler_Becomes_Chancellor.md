# Hitler Becomes Chancellor

## Remaining Barriers to Hitler and the Nazis

- Between 1929 and 1932, the Nazis’ support and representation in the Reichstag had increased massively
- However, Presdient Hindenburg remained a barrier to Hitler and the Nazis’ ascent to power
    - He was a national hero and well respected by the people because he was the senior commander in WW1
    - He did not really like democracy but served as President (1925-1929) to serve as a force of stability for the sake of the country
        - He was even convinced to stand for elections again in 1932 even though he wanted to retire and **won** it
            - This was a problem for the Nazis because he disliked Hitler, believing he would destabilize Germany.

## Hitler’s Rise to Chancellor

In June 1932, Hindenburg appoints Franz von Papen as chancellor

- Hindenburg had wanted a chancellor who had the support of the Reichstag
    - Allow him to take measures without having to call elections and deal with disputes

In July 1932, Hindenburg calls elections hoping von Papen would get enough support in the new Reichstag to create a functioning government

- The plan failed
    - The nazis became the single largest party in the Reichstag with 230 seats (but still not a majority)
        - Hitler demanded to be chancellor
    - von Papen was still able to form a government

In November 1932, Hindenburg called another election

- The Nazis remained the largest party in the Reichstag, but their vote share fell by >2 million and they lost 38 seats

In December 1932, Hindenburg appointed Kurt von Schleicher as Chancellor

- He was a former army general and an old army friend of Hindenburg
- He tried and failed to get Nazi support and was forced to resign.

Throughout 1933, a desperate Hindenburg and von Papen met with industrialists, army leaders and politicians in a bid to create a new functional government

Ultimately, on 30 January 1933, they offered Hitler the post of Chancellor

- von Papen was to be vice-chancellor and there would only be a few other Nazis in senior positions in the new Cabinet
- Despite these limits, public opinion was mixed on the appointment
- They were confident they could control Hitler
    - They believed they could work with Nazi opponents to curb his influence and, if need be, unseat him.
    - They were more concerned with the support of Nazis to restore stability and creating a functional government.

## The Nazi Party’s Rise to Power - Summary

There are three key factors leading to the Nazi Party’s rise to power:

1. Weaknesses of the Weimar Republic
2. Economic Challenges in Germany
3. Appeal of the Nazi Party

| Factors | Examples | Explanations | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weaknesses of the Weimar Republic | - Weak constitution of the Weimar Republic
- Unpopularity of the Weimar Republic with the German people. | This led to the Nazi Party’s rise to power because… the Weimar Republic was formed based on the Weimar Constitution, subjecting the government to the weaknesses of the constitution. The people were unhappy with the government for accepting the Treaty of Versailles which they thought punished Germany unfairly. It became an unpopular government faced with opposition from both the left and right wing. | This drove people to support the Nazis who seemed to be a strong political party and were strongly opposed to the Treaty of Versailles. |
| Economic Challenges in Germany | - The Great Depression 
- High unemployment rate in the early 1930s. | This led to the Nazi Party’s rise to power because… the Great Depression led to economic collapse in Germany and unemployment skyrocketed. The economic crisis hit the middle-class the hardest and many workers felt that the crisis had not been well-managed by the government. This caused them to turn away from democracy and look towards other forms of government. | This provided a favourable climate for Hitler’s Nazi Party to rise to power. |
| Appeal of Hitler and the Nazi Party | - Fear of Communism
- Hitler’s charisma and oratorical skills
- The SA and the SS
- Success of Nazi political campaigns | This led to the Nazi Party’s rise to power because… business leaders and farmers looked to the Nazi Party to oppose the Communists. In addition, Hitler was a powerful speaker and the Nazis seemed to be the answer to various problems faced by the German people. Nazi political campaigns were also clever and effective in winning the support of the Germans, with heavy use of propaganda | All these led to a surge in support for the Nazis, allowing them to rise to power. |
