# Meiji Period (1868 - 1912)

## Background

Throughout the 1800s (i.e. before the Meiji Period), Japan observed European powers taking advantage of China due to its political instability.

- The Europeans forced China to sign unfair treaties
- Japan viewed this with concern

By the 1850s, Japan was forced to open up by the USA as warships of its Navy sailed into Tokyo Bay

- Specifically when on July 8 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry of the United States Navy sailed into Tokyo harbour

The US demanded that Japan sign treaties that would give it more opportunties for trade

- Recognising that the US would use force and they could not defeat them, the Japanese signed the treaties.

The easy capitulation of the Shogunate ultimately led to rebellion.

By 1868, the rebellion concluded with the Shogun losing his power and Emperor Meiji took control of the government.

This marked the start of the Meiji Period / Meiji Restoration.

- This was an era of modernisation.
- They did not want to repeat the encounter with the US or end up like China.
- To facilitate this, in 1871, the Meiji government sent academics and other officials to the USA and Europe to learn how the Western nations ran their governments, economies and militaries.

### Economic Modernisation

- Following the principle of *Fukoku Kyohei* (Enrich the country, Strengthen the Army)
    - Sought to strengthen Japan’s economic foudations to facilitate the strengthening of its military to allow it to better defend against foreign invaders
- Industrialised its economy
- Using Western techonology, its production rapidly increased.
- Infrastructure (e.g. banking systems, railroads, etc.) were setup to support its increased production
- Powerful megacorporations known as zaibatsu were established.
- Japan also began to open up
- It engaged in foreign trade
- Started to export goods to the rest of the world.
