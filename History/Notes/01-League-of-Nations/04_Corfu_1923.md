# Attempts at Keeping Peace - League of Nations

## Corfu, 1923

One of the borders that had to be decided after the war was between Albania and Greece. The Conference of Ambassadors was given this task. Three Italian officials were killed while surveying the Greek side of the frontier area. Italian leader Benito Mussolini blamed the Greeks, demanded compensation, and attacked and ocupied the Greek island of Corfu. Greece appealed to the League for help but Mussolini insisted that this dispute should be resolved by the Conference of Ambassadors, not the League. The British wanted to stand up to Mussolini. However, the French was involved in a disp;ute with Germany in the Ruhr region over reparations and did not want a dispute with Italy as well.

In the end, Mussolini got his way. The Conference of Ambassadors ruled that the Greeks must apologise and pay compensation directly to Italy. if Britain and France had stood together, Mussolini would probably not have gotten his way.
