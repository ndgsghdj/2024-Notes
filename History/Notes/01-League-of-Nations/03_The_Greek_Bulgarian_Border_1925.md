## The Greek Bulgarian Border, 1925

In October 1925, some Greek soldiers were killed on Greece's border with Bulgaria. When Greek troops invaded, Bulgaria appealed to the League for help. The League demanded both sides to stand down and told Greece to withdraw. Britain and France supported the League's judgement. Greece obeyed, but pointed out that there seemeed seemed to be one rule for large states such as Italy and another for smaller ones such as itself. The outcome was seen as a major success for the League, and optimism about its effectiveness soared.
