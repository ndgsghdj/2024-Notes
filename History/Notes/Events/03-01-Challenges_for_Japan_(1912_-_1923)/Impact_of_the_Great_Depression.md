## Impact of the Great Depression

### On Farmers

- As exports fell, it led to reduced demand for farmers’ produce
- On average, incomes of the farmers fell 43% between 1929-1931
- Tenant farmers tried to get landowners to reduce rents
    - Landowners refused and even tried to evict their tenants who could pay their rent
    - Tenant farmers organised themselves into unions
        - They held protest meetings
        - They took landowners to court
        - Some disputes turned violent

### On Small Business Owners

- Small business owners = owners of shops, restaurants, small factories, etc.
- They struggled to attract customers
    - E.g. 1930: 2x as many small business closures as an average year.
- Many small business owners joined protest movements
    - e.g. Imperial Middle Class Federated Alliance
        - Claimed that the political parties were favouring landowners, banks and zaibatsu whilst not helping small businesses.

### Unemployment

- Caused mass unemployment
    - E.g. Between 1930 and 1932, ~15-20% of Japan’s workforce lost their jobs
- Difficulty of the unemployed were made harder by Japan’s labour laws
    - Most workers were only entitled to 14 days’ pay when they were dismissed
- Desperate workers protested, sometimes violently.

### Fear of Communism

- With increasing unemployment, workers began attracted to communism
    - However, the Japanese Communist Party was very small
- Nevertheless, the government feared the threat of communism
    - This fear was fostered by the USSR
        - It was close to Japan, with Japanese colonies in Korea and Manchuria directly bordering the Communist state

### Growing Distrust in Government

- Due to combined effects of the existing economic problems and the Great Depression, the Japanese believed that the civilian government only cared about the elites (banks, landowners, zaibatsu)
- A strong feeling of distrust towards the civilian politicians
    - They believed they were either working with the zaibatsu/elites or were receiving money and benefits from them.

| Role of the zaibatsu                             | Long-term factor     | This factor is a long-term factor because… the centralisation of economic power under the zaibatsu and thus political influence fostered resentment among the Japanese people who increasingly saw the civilian government as working in the interests of said corporations at their expense. |
| The role of the Emperor                          | Long-term factor     | This factor is a long-term factor because… the centralisation of political power within the office of the Emperior meant that should he prove an incapable leader, periods of political instaibility were inevitable.                                                                         |
| The role of the military                         | Long-term factor     | This factor is a long-term factor because… the disproportionate influence over the political system possessed by the military meant that it was a persistent threat to civilain rule.                                                                                                             |
| The weak authority of the Prime Minister         | Long-term factor     | This factor is a long-term factor because… this had been a challenge faced by the Prime Minister since the Meiji restoration and severely weakened his position as he was unable to exert his authority.                                                                                        |
| The divide between the rich and the poor         | Short-term factor    | This factor is a short-term factor because… it was a phenomenon that led to resentment between the increasing wealthy zaibatsu and the poor peasants which undermined the authority of the civilian government.                                                                                   |
| Inflation and unemployment in Japan in the 1920s | Short-term factor    | This factor is a short-term factor because… the inability of the civilian government to effectively deal with this economic crisis resulted in growing resentment towards it.                                                                                                                     |
| The 1927 Banking Crisis                          | Short-term factor    | This factor is a short-term factor because… although government interventions eventually stabilised the situation, many Japanese had suffered the lost of their savings and thus had grown resentful towards the government’s slow response.                                               |
| The Great Depression, 1929                       | Short-term factor    | This factor is a short-term factor because… it led to the resentment among the Japanese as the Japanese government proved itself unable to resolve the economic problems the Great Depression of 1929 brought to Japan.                                                                          |
