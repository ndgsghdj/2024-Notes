## Tensions in Japanese Society

- The rapid economic and social changes of the Meiji period caused a number of societal divisions

### Rich-poor divide

- Government support of the zaibatsu
    - Built cooperation and trust between the government and big businesses
    - Concentrated wealth in the hands of the big businesses

### Rural-urban divide

- Richest landlords did not work on the farms and made up only ~2-3% of the population, but lived on rent from tenant farmers
- Landlords lived in luxury in sharp contrast to the poverty of the tenant farmers
- Unhappiness of the poor led to uprisings such as the **Rice Riots of 1918**
    - These riots were led by angry workers and triggered by sudden increase in commodities, especially rice.

### Changing role of women

Traditionalists who worried about Japan losing its identity, one common complaint was that young women were abandoning their traditional roles.

- During the 1920s, many young women found jobs (e.g. in cafes, restaurants, silk mills and factories)
- Conditions were harsh but wages were reasonable
- Many young women found greater independence
    - Some even became active in politics
- They were seen as a threat to traditional Japanese society and values
    - They were accused of serving their own interests instead of the needs of their families
