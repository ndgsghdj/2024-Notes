## Civilian Government and Politicians

- Divided by emergence of political parties
    - E.g. Seiyukai and Minseito were political rivals which wrestled for power and influence in the government.
- Division between the parties made it difficult for the PM to gain support for their decisions
    - Many Taisho-period PMs and Cabinets were unable to remain in power
    - Some cabinets could not even be formed when the military refused to supply ministers for the army and the navy.

# Economic Challenges

Although the Japanese economy made remarkable advances in the early 1900s, it repeatedly swung from boom to recession.

### World War 1, 1914 - 1918

Without competition from European countries involved in the war, Japanese exports benefitted (e.g. Overseas sales of Japanese cotton cloth rose by 185%)

### Inflation and Unemployment in Japan in the 1920s

However, by the early 1920sâ€¦

- Severe inflation set in and made Japanese goods very expensive (E.g. Rice increased 174% in price)
- There was high unemployment as a result of layoffs resulting from a decline in demand for Japanese goods
- Growing resentment towards the civilian government

Situation was worsened by the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake
