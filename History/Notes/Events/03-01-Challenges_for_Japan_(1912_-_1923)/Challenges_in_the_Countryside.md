## Challenges in the Countryside

- Industrial growth led to increased living standards for most Japanese
    - E.g. Access to cheaper and better goods; improved services and infrastructure
    - However, the countryside did not enjoy such benefits as urbanites
        - Insufficient land due to large population growth
            - Majority of farmers were tenant farmers
                - Had to pay most of their harvest to landlords, leaving little for themselves
            - Many farmers who owned their land, owned only small plots and often had poor harvests
        - By 1920s, technological advances in farming began to be unable to spread through the countryside quickly enough.
            - The productivity of the farmers stagnated
