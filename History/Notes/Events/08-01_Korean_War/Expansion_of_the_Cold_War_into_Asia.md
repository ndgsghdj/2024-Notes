## Expansion of the Cold War into Asia

### Expansion of Communism in China

- Following the end of WWII, the Chinese Civil War resumed as Mao Zedong's Chinese Communist Party (CCP) fought against Chiang Kai-Shek's GMD for control over China.
    * The CCP was victorious and China became a communist state in October 1949.
    * The United States was concerned about the implications of China turning communist.

#### Reasons for American Concerns

- It had made significant investments in the GMD
    * E.g. Between 1946 and 1949, it pumped US$2 billion in aid into China largely to the GMD.
- However, by December 1949, the GMD government was defeated,
    * They established themselves on the island of Formosa (Taiwan), which is off the Chinese mainland.
    * With the victory of the CCP, there was now a massive new communist state on the map.
- The United States became fearful that communism might start spreading throughout Asia.
    * Hence, it refused to accept the legitimacy of the CCP government and continued to back the GMD government in Taiwan.
- __Soviet Response__
    * The Soviets were delighted with the communist victory in China.
        + They had supported Mao and his movement during the Chinese Civil War.
        + Now they had a powerful new ally against the United States.
    * In February 1950, the two communist powers signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.
    * This came a month after Acheson's announcement of the US defensive perimeter.
- The Sino-Soviet Treaty set out various agreements about land and transport in East Asia.
    * It also involved a cumulative loan of $300 million from the USSR to help China rebuild after years of war.
