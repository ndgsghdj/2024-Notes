## Stalin Shifts His Position on Korea

- Before 1950, Stalin was not interested in helping Kim.
- However, this changed as both superpowers sought to expand their global influence, especially in the Asia-Pacific region.
    * Having control and influence over Korea would provide the USSR with a platform to spread communist ideology and also to counterbalance the United States' influence in Japan.
- When communist China emerged under Mao, Stalin had also gained a powerful ally which had a border with North Korea.
    * The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in February 1950 also reflected the USSR greater confidence in cooperating with China.
    * If there was conflict in Korea, then it seemed likely that Mao would be responsible for supplying the troops and support for North Korea
    * At the same time, it would be another problem for the United States to deal with.
