## Aftermath of the Korean War


### Aftermath


- The war was devastating for Korea and its people
    * Examples
        + ~3-4 million casualties.
            + ~1.4 million dead.
        + Many cities, towns and villages were destroyed
        + Hundreds of thousands of people became refugees
        + North Korea was particularly devastated by US bombing raids.
- The economies of North and South Korea were shattered
    * Examples
        + Roads, bridges, railway lines, factories, power plants and many other facilities were destroyed.
        + Massive destruction of industries
            + 70% of the textile industry
            + 70% of the chemical industry
            + 51% of mining industry

### Impact of the Korean War on Korea


- The armistice in July 1953 =/= official peace treaty
- There were two main issues influencing the talks

#### Prisoner of Wars


- 90,000 South Korean POWs and 8,000 UN POWs
- 100,000 North Korean POWs
- Many POWs died in captivity and it remains a sensitive subject to this day.
- A small number of UN and South Korean POWs opted to remain in North Korea or China, while a much larger proportion of North Korean troops tried to stay in South Korea.
- In theory, the issue of POWs was settled in the armistice talks.
    * However, there was suspicion on both sides about whether all POWs had been returned.
    * Many returning POWs also reported that they were treated with suspicion because of the fear that they had been brainwashed by the enemy and would act against their country.
- This disagreement of the Korean War POWs led to hostility between the two Koreas and the superpowers, thus contributing to tensions.

#### The Border Between North and South Korea


- The communists wanted the division of Korea to be at the 38th parallel.
- The United Nations and South Korea disagreed.
    * They wanted the division to be along the battle lines established between the two sides.
- To settle the issue of the border, __the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ)__ was created between North and South Korea.
    * Both sides agreed to move their troops back about two kilometers from the border, now known as the Military Demarcation Line.
- Since then, there would have been many border skirmishes between the two sides, but war has not resumed. The DMZ still exists and the border between North and South Korea remains the most militarised in the world today.
- This tense border serves as a source of tensions between the Koreas and superpowers.

### Impact of the Korean War on US Foreign Policy


- The Korean War was the 1st military conflict in the Cold War
    * Before this, Cold War confrontations had been fought through political methods, the media and propaganda (including the Berlin Blockade)

#### Proxy Wars


- Korea was the __first proxy war__
- Proxy wars are conflicts when the two superpowers - the United States and the USSR - but where they do not fight directly against each other.
    * Instead they provided arms, money and other support to the groups which shared their political views or were against their opponent's.
- The Korean War as a proxy war
    * Although the United States put troops in Korea, the USSR did not. And in theory, the Chinese troops were volunteers and not officially under the command of communist China.
- The Korean War was also an example of how a local dispute could escalate into a superpower conflict.
- This marked the beginnings of a new type of competition between the superpowers that served to escalate tensions.

#### Creation of Alliances and Escalation of Tensions


- The Korean War prompted the United States to become freshly determined to pursue its policy of containment in Asia.
    * South Korea, Japan and Taiwan became central to US policy in Asia.
    * The United States stationed troops and significant air power and naval ships in South Korea and in Japan.
- The United States also extended its network of alliances beyond NATO.
- In 1954, it set up a network of anti-communist alliances around the world
    * The Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) in Southeast Asia
    * The Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) in Central Asia and the Middle East.
    * The United States gave money, advice and arms to these allies. In return, the leaders of these countries suppressed communist influence at home.
- The expansion of American alliances alarmed the USSR, escalating tensions.
- The USSR saw American alliances as aggressive.
- It accused the United States of trying to encircle the communist world.
    * To counter NATO, the USSR set up the Warsaw Treaty Organisation, better known as the Warsaw Pact, in 1955.
        + This included the USSR and all the communist Eastern Europe countries except Yugoslavia.
    * The formation of the Warsaw Pact in response to NATO and other American alliances, solidified the world into two competing blocs led by the superpowers led to an escalation of tensions.

#### Increase in Military Power


- As a result of the Korean War, the United States intensified its military power to enforce its policy of containment by military means, if necessary.
- __Increase in American Military Power__
    * __Before 1950, __the United States had been fighting the Cold War primarily through political activity and the media and thus was scaling down its forces.
    * But __by 1951,__ US armed forces had doubled in size compared to the previous year.
    * The United States' NATO allies took a similar approach. European military power grew dramatically.
- __Increase in NATO Military Power__
    * When the Korean War began, NATO countries had only 14 army divisions and spent approximately 5.5 per cent of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on the military.
    * By the time the war ended, NATO had 15 divisions stationed in West Germany alone, and NATO countries were spending more than 12 percent of their GDP on defence.
- The increase of American military power alarmed the USSR, escalating tensions.

### Conclusion


- The Korean War was one of the most destructive conflicts in the world
    * Millions of casualties and many major cities were destroyed.
- The Korean War was also one of the first instances of a military conflict in the Cold War
- It confirmed the status of communist China as an influential player in the international arena
- The creation of anti-communist alliances and the Warsaw Pact as a result of the Korean War worsened relations and heightened tensions between the superpowers.
- The effects of the war are still evident today where families remain separated on either side of the 38th parallel, yearning for a reunion.
    * Even now, there has been no reunification of the Korean Peninsula.
