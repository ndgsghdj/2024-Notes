## The Division of Korea into North and South


### Aftermath of WW2


- Following the end of WW2, in towns and villages, locals formed political committees to maintain order and to replace the Japanese government and the Korean officials who had served the Japanese.
- It would have been very difficult to unite the country.
    * There was a lot of bitterness left over from the years when the country was occupied by the Japanese. In many areas, people sought to take revenge against those who had collaborated with the Japanese.
- The United States and the USSR met several times from 1946 to 1947 to determine a way of administering Korea after the war.
    * While they agreed that it should be unified under a provisional government, they differed on how to unite and administer it, as both were wary of each other.
    * In 1947, the United Nations called for free elections to be held in Korea to establish a government for a unified Korea.

### North Korea and the USSR


- In the North, the Soviets were happy to allow __Kim Il Sung__ to establish control through the political committees and his loyal followers.
    * He had been trained in the USSR and had fought alongside the Chinese communists against the Japanese.
- Keen to establish their political and economic influence over their zone of occupation, the USSR did not allow the elections to take place in it.
    * With the support of the USSR, the North Koreans established the __Democratic People's Republic of Korea (or North Korea)__ on 9 September 1948, recognising Kim as the leader.
    * Additionally, the Soviet forces were to withdraw by the end of 1948.
- As the leader of North Korea, Kim:
    * Tapped on propaganda extensively to develop a cult of personality.
    * Promoting self-sufficiency, he isolated the country from the rest of the world to limit external influence and opposition.
    * Convinced that the whole of Korea should be united under one rule, Kim was also willing to resort to the use of force to achieve his aim.

### South Korea and the United States


- In May 1948, 80 percent of the eligible population took part in a national election in the area south of the 38th parallel.
    * The United States backed __Syngman Rhee__ for the position of president as Rhee had campaigned for Korean independence during the Japanese Occupation.
    * However, he had not lived in Korea for some time. The United states favoured Rhee primarily because he was deeply anti-communist, a fluent English speaker and a graduate from prestigious universities in the United States.
- After gaining a majority of votes in the election, Rhee became the president of the newly founded __Republic of Korea (or South Korea)__ in August 1948.
- Furthermore, the US forces were to withdraw from South Korea by June 1949.
- Over the years, Rhee grew increasingly authoritarian, arresting and even killing his political opponents, including suspected communists.
- Despite their disagreements with Rhee's policies, the United states continued to support Rhee and his government due to their anti-communist stance, so as to prevent the spread of communist influence from the North.
- Similar to Kim, Rhee also believed that Korea should be unified under his rule.

### Tensions between North Korea and South Korea


- From 1945 to 1948, relations between North and South Korea were hostile but relatively quiet.
    * Kim and Rhee disliked each other intensely.

#### Kim


- Tried several times to persuade Stalin to support an attempt to reunify Korea.
- However, Stalin took little interest.
    * Soviet resources had been severely stretched during WWII. His overwhelming priority was to create a buffer zone of communist states in Eastern Europe to protect the USSR.
    * Stalin was not keen to stir up more conflict with the United States and further strain Soviet resources by arming and supplying North Korea in a war.

#### Rhee


- Was also eager to force the issue of Korean reunification.
- While Rhee had the backing of the united States.
    * Truman refused to provide South Korea with large supplies of weapons for fear that they would be used to attack North Korea.
- Even so, he initiated border clashes to capture territories in the North.

#### Skirmishes in the lead-up to the Korean War


- In July 1949, South Korean warships attacked North Korea's military installations near Taedong River, sinking most of North Korea's west coast fleet.
- From 1949 onwards, fierce fighting broke out frequently around the 38th parallel.
- First half of 1950: Other border skirmishes and hundreds of small-scale assaults also occurred across the parallel
- These skirmishes resulted in heavy casualties on both sides.
- By the end of 1948, the Korean Peninsula was divided and became a place of great tension.
    * A civil war between North and South to reunify the country was a very real possibility.

### US and Soviet Disinterest in Korea


- At that time, it seemed unlikely that Korea would play a significant role in the development of the Cold War.
    * The Americans had decided that Korea lay outside their "defensive perimeter" in the Asia-Pacific
- __USA:__ This defensive perimeter was a security policy announced by US Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, in January 1950.
    * In his speech, Acheson emphasised the importance of Japan and the Philipines to the United States.
    * Japan was still under the occupation and rehabilitation of the Allies after WW2, while the Philippines was its former colony.
    * As a result, he made a clear commitment that US military forces would protect these areas.
    * __The Korean Peninsula, however, was noticeably absent from Acheson's speech.__
- __USSR:__ Prior to 1949, Stalin was reluctant to support Kim in conquering South Korea as he did not want to risk direct military confrontation with the United States.
- The eventual exit of both the United States and the USSR indicated that the superpowers had no intention to be heavily involved in the matters in Korea.
