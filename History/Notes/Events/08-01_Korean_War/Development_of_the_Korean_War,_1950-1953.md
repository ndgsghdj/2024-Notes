## Development of the Korean War, 1950-1953

### The War Begins

- On __25 June 1950__, North Korea invaded South Korea.

#### Truman's Response

- Truman immediately sent advisors, supplies and warships to the waters around Korea.
- At the same time, he put enormous pressure on the United Nations Security Council to condemn the North Koreans' actions and to call on them to withdraw their troops.

Truman would probably have intervened in Korea even without UN support, but he obtained it as circumstances favoured him.
- Like the United States, the USSR had the power to veto any decision made by the UN.
- However, it was boycotting the UN then as it was protesting the UN's refusal to grant membership to communist China after the Chinese Civil War.
- Thus, the USSR was not present to use its veto when the resolutions on the situation in Korea were passed.

### The War Begins - Continued

- The UN was now committed to using member forces to drive North Korean troops out of South Korea.
- The United States forces:
    * Were under the command of US General __Douglas MacArthur__.
    * The US was the largest contributor of troops to the UN forces.
    * The UN forces included troops from other countries, including Turkey, the Philippines, India and Thailand, and they fought alongside thousands of South Korean troops.
    * Some countries sent combat troops, whilst others provided medical services or transportation

### The Course of the War

#### Phase 1: Rapid North Korean Advance - June-September 1950

- When the war began in __Jun 1950__, North Korean forces advanced rapidly.
    * They captured Seoul, the capital of South Korea, and were soon in command of most of South Korea.
- South Korean forces held on to a small area around the port of Busan, which allowed UN forces to reinforce them and hold back the North Korean advance.

#### Phase 2: Rapid UN Counteroffensive - September-Mid-October 1950

- In __September 1950,__ UN forces landed at Incheon, near Seoul. At the same time, the UN forces in Busan drove the North Koreans back.
    * MacArthur quickly achieved the original UN objective of removing North Korean troops from South Korea
    * But they did not stop there, as MacArthur had wanted to take advantage of the retreating army to eradicate communism.
- The UN approved a plan to advance into North Korea.
    * However, Truman was wary of the involvement of the Soviets and the Chinese forces and cautioned MacArthur to limit operations north of the 38th parallel.
    * MacArthur continued to advance into North Korea despite China's warning that it would intervene to defend its border and launch a full-scale war if the Americans crossed the 38th parallel and advanced towards the Yalu River, which was the border between China and North Korea.
        + Mao did not want a unified Korea on his border which was non-communist and an ally to the United States. He also felt his personal prestige and China's prestige were at stake.

#### Phase 3: Chinese and North Korean Counteroffensive - Mid-October 1950-April-1950

 - In __mid-October 1950__, Chinese forces began crossing into North Korea secretly.
 - MacArthur defied direct orders from Truman and the UN, and continued advancing towards Yalu River, potentially advancing the scale of the war.
     * He was also ready to use the atomic bomb against China and North Korea.
 - __Late in October 1950,__ 200,000 Chinese troops (part of the "People's Volunteer Army") joined the North Koreans.
     * They were highly motivated and equipped with Soviet tanks and aircraft.
 - From __December 1950 - January 1951__, the UN forces were pushed back into South Korea.
 - In __April 1951,__ MacArthur was dismissed by Truman and replaced by General Matthew Ridgeway.
 - As the war was ongoing, the Americans also employed psychological warfare to convince the North Koreans to stop fighting for the communists.

#### Phase 4: Stalemate - July 1951 - July 1953

- __July 1951:__ The UN troops then recovered and resumed their attacks towards the north. Armistice talks began at Panmunjom.
- __June 1951 - July 1953:__ The fighting reached a stalemate and the armistice talks stalled due to disagreements over the terms.
- __April-July 1953:__ The armistice talks resumed at Panmunjom and the armistice was signed later.

### The Korean Armistice Agreement

- The war dragged on for another two years from 1951.
    * For this, some scholars blamed the Americans because they took a very hard line in the peace talks.
    * Others claim the war was dragged on by Mao and Stalin because they wanted to tie down US forces and Mao wanted to give its army combat experience.
- The negotiations during the armistice talks in July 1951 were not easy and the fighting persisted till 1953, when a ceasefire was agreed and __an armistice was signed in July 1953.__
