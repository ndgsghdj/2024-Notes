## The US Shifts Its Position on Korea

- Due to their growing fears about the spread of communism, by April 1950, the US defensive perimeter was effectively expanding.
- The United States was changing its position to oppose any attempt to spread communism in Asia.
    * This was outlined by the US State Department in a top-secret report known as National Security Council Paper No. 68 (NSC-68)
        + It set out a more assertive and aggressive US foreign policy to deal with the communist threat.
- The NSC-68 would prove decisive for Korea
    * Its situation was becoming more dangerous with rising tensions and clashes between troops across the border.
- US policy before was to simply let North and South Korea fight it out if a war broke out between them.
    * With the drafting of NSC-68, Truman would have been inclined to intervene if a war broke out.
    * He could not risk the possibility of a victory by North Korea, which would be a triumph for communism and a humiliation fo r the United States.
