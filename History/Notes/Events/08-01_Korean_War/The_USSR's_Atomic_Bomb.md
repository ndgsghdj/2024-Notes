## The USSR's Atomic Bomb


- In August 1949, the USSR successfully detonated its first atomic bomb.
- This meant that the United States no longer had the upper hand.
- Therefore by the late 1949 and early 1950, Stalin's decision to support Kim's request to invade South Korea became less difficult.
