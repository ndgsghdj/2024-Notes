## Hitler becomes Leader of the Nazi Party

In July 1921, Hitler overthrew Drexler and becomes leader of the Nazi party

- Appointed allies to key roles
    - E.g. Hermann Goering was put in charge of the Stormtroopers (Sturmabteilung/SA/Brownshirts)

**Who were the Brownshirts?**

- Ex-soldiers who were members of the Nazi party
- Started as an informal group that provided security at Nazi events
- Hitler transformed them into a private army with uniforms and a command structure
- Hitler used them against rivals both within and outside the party.

By November 1923, there were around 50,000 members of the Nazi Party.

- Many of these were from the thousands of Germans who turned up to hear Hitler speak at Nazi meetings
    - Many were impressed by Hitler and the energy and commitment of the Nazis

On November 1923, Hitler launched the Munich Putsch

- Why?
    - By then the Weimar Republic had experienced years of problems
    - Hitler was popular and well known in Munich
    - He had support of important figures e.g. Erich Ludendorff
- What happened?
    - Hitler and his followers marched on the city of Munich
    - He expected the local government, police and troops to support him
    - They were instead met by armed police and a battle broke out
    - 16 Nazis and 4 policemen were killed
- Aftermath
    - Nazi Party was banned
    - Key Nazi leaders escaped harsh punishment
        - Ludendorff faced no punishment
            - Was elected to the Reichstag in 1924
    - Hitler escaped but was arrested 2 days later
        - Was allowed by the judge and used his trial to make long speeches criticising the Weimar Republic and setting out his ideas
        - The trail was covered extensively and Hitler became a national celebrity
        - Eventually sentenced to 5 years in Landsberg Prison
            - He only served 9 months
            - Conditions for him in the prison were very comfortable
                - He had visitors and access to books
            - He spent the time writing *Mein Kampf*
        - Powerful groups (e.g. judges) held similar views/were influenced by the Nazis
        - After the Munich Putsch, Hitler concluded that the Nazis could not seize power by force
            - They had to work within the democratic system
        - As soon as he was released from prison, Hitler rebuilt the Nazi Party towards the above goal
            - He did so based on the ideas he outlined in *Mein Kampf*
    - Key ideas in Mein Kampf
        - Total loyalty to the leader (Fuehrer aka Hitler)
        - Loyalty to Germany, racial purity, equality and state control
        - Aryans (Blond, blue-eyed, tall and of Nordic origin and descent) were the master race
            - All other races, especially the Jews, were inferior
        - War and struggle were essential to the development of a healthy Aryan race
        - Germany needed Lebensraum (living space)
            - It would mainly achieved through expansion into Russia and Poland
