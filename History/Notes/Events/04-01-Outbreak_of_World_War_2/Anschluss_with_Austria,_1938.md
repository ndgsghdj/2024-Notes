## Anschluss with Austria, 1938

### Background

- Hitler moved to unite the Germans of Austria with Germany
    - This was specifically forbidden by the TOV
    - Many Austrians wanted to be part of Hitler’s new and successful Germany

### What happened?

- In 1938, Hitler encouraged the Austrian Nazi Party to create disorder and agitate for union between Germany and Austria/Anschluss
- Proceeded to convince Austrian Chancellor, Kurt Schuschnigg, that only German troops could restore order
- Schuschnigg appealed to Britain and France for help
    - They did nothing
- In March 1938, Hitler moved troops into Austria
- In April 1938, Hitler held a plebiscite on Anschluss
    - 99.75% of votes were in favor
        - This was the result of voter intimidation and fraud

### Consequences

- Germany’s size and stature strengthened
    - Absorbed Austria’s population, industry, and natural resources
    - Gained access to Austria’s gold reserves
- Increased Hitler’s power and standing
    - Violated TOV, but Britain and France did nothing
        - E.g. British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, even suggested to Hitler before the Anschluss that Britain would not oppose it
- Demonstrated that Britain and France found it hard to deal with a politician/government who simply did not care about the rules and traditions of international diplomacy
- They misunderstood and underestimated Hitler/Nazi Germany
