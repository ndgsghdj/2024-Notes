## Hitlerâ€™s Concerns


- Hitler wanted to reclaim the Polish Corridor ([Further reading](https://www.britannica.com/place/Polish-Corridor)) and the city of Danzig
    - Confident that the Polish forces could be defeated
- Hitler thought Britain and France would not go to war over Poland
- Hitler worried that USSR would oppose a German invasion of Poland
    - Poland bordered the USSR
    - If the USSR opposed it, there was a chance it might trigger Britain and France to do so as well
        - This would lead to a two-front war which would be disadvantageous for Germany
