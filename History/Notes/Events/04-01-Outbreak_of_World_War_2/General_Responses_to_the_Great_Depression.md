    - Overall trade volume fell.

### Calling in Loans

- As the US economy struggled, US banks recalled loans
    - This led to the collapse of banks and businesses (both within the USA and other countries)
        - Caused mass unemployment

### Rearmament

- Many countries (e.g. Britain, France, Italy, German, Japan, etc.) began remarming to boost industry and create jobs.
