### Examples of Impacts of the Great Depression


**USA**

- Top priority - sort out US economy
- Low priority - help sort out international disputes
- The Depression made the USA even more unwilling to support League of Nations sanctions because economic sanctions would make its own economy even worse.

**Britain**

- Top priority - protect the economy
- Low priority - international co-operation
- Adopted a policy of protectionism. This was achieved through tariffs (taxes on imports) in order to protect its own economy from foreign competition.
- Britain was one of the leaders of the League of Nations. But due to the Depressionm was unwilling to help sort out international disputes. For example, when Japan invaded Manchuria it did nothing.

**France**

- Top priority - protection from Germany
- Low priority - international co-operation
- Like most European countries, France was hit hard by the depression. Its own exports of food, wine, cars nad other goods declined.
- Became very concerned about the rise of Nazism in Germany. It began to rearm on a large scale and built a line of fortifications along the border between France and Germany (e.g. the Maginot Line)

**Italy**

- Top priority - resources and prestige
- Low priority - international co-operation
- Italy exported wine and food produce to the USA. Italy also produced cars and other manufactured goods. People in the USA cut back on fancy imported food during the Depression. All over the world, people stopped buying expensive goods like cars. Other states which imported Italian goods also cut back.
- As a result, Italy’s economy suffered and unemployment rose
    - Italians found that their wages would buy less
- Their leader, Mussolini, had promised to make Italy a great power and build a colonial empire in Africa. By the early 1930s, many Italians believed that owning a colonial empire would be economically beneficial to the country.

**Germany**

- Top priority - tackle unemployment and reverse Treaty of Versailles
- Low priority - international co-operation
- Germany suffered terrible economic problems in the early 1920s. It recovered after 1924 because American banks gave loans to German businesses had to pay up.
- They began to collapse and unemployment soared to over 6 million. This was a major crisis
- Germany’s democratic politicians just couldn’t save the economy
    - Workers faced the humiliation of queuing up for food handouts
    - Many feared that they might starve.
    - Many middle class people were ruined
    - Banks collapsed and they lost their savings
    - Big business leaders worried that there might be a revolution in Germany.
- Almost everybody blamed the Treaty of Versailles and the reparations bill for Germany’s problems
- Some German political parties (such as the Nazi party), started advocating for the expansion of German territory as a solution to some of the economic problems. These parties became popular in the wake of the Great Depression.
