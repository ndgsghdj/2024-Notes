## Stalin’s Concerns

- Stalin's concerns over Hitler had grown over the 1930s.
- The USSR took steps to balance out Hitler’s growing power:
    - In 1934, they joined the League of Nations (LON).
    - In 1936, they signed a Mutual Assistance Pact with France.
- Stalin saw that Britain, France, and the League had not resisted Hitler.
- His concerns spiked after the Munich Agreement.
    - He had not been consulted
    - Seemed like Britain and France were allowing Hitler to take over Eastern Europe
