## Background

Instead of “getting tough” on Hitler in the 1930s, Britain and France adopted a policy known as appeasement, which involved giving in to Hitler's demands.

- In 1937, the new British PM, Neville Chamberlain, continued to pursue a policy of appeasement towards Hitler.
    - He was well aware of the threat of Hitler
    - However, realised that Britain was not yet prepared for war
        - Authorised massive spending on rearmament
        - Recognised Britain and France needed to support each other to face Hitler
            - Worked to strengthen their cooperation with each other
