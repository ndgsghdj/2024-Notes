## Persecution of Minorities

Anyone not belonging to the Aryan race were persecuted

- They persecuted members of other races and minority groups (e.g. Roma/gypsies), homosexuals and the mentally ill

They also persecuted any group thought to be a challenge to Nazi ideas

E.g.

- 1/3 of Roma in Germany in 1939 were killed

They further sought to ‘improve’ the Aryan race through eugenics and euthanasia

- Over 300,000 men and women were sterilised between 1934 and 1935.
- A “euthanasia programme” of the disabled and mentally ill (even Aryans) began in 1939
    - >5,000 disabled babies killed between 1939-1945
    - 72,000 mentally ill patients killed between 1939 - 1941
        - Stopped when there was a public outcry
