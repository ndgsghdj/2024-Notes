## Working Conditions in Nazi Germany


Lower unemployment brought about by Nazi policies

- Boosted their support among workers

**Propaganda**

- Praised workers
- Associated Hitler with them e.g. calling him Germany’s “First Worker”

**Other measures also sought to win their loyalty**

- **Strength Through Joy (Kraft durch Freude / kdF)**
    - Gave workers cheap theatre and cinema tickets
    - Organised events e.g. courses, trips, sports
    - Offered discounted cruises on luxury liners
    - By 1939, >50 million Germans had been on a KdF holiday
- **Beauty of Labour (Schonheit der Arbeit)**
    - Improved working conditions
        - Introduced washing facilities and low-cost canteens
    - **Programme to help workers buy a Volkswagen Beetle**
        - Became symbolic of a prosperous new Germany
        - But no worker ever received one by 1939 when the war ended all car production

### Impact


Workers lost…

- Their main political party i.e. the SDP
- Their trade unions
- Bred resentment

All workers had to join the German Labour Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront/DAF) which…

- Prevented strikes for better pay and conditions

Wages remained comparatively low

- Though prices of goods were also kept low

**By the late 1930s, many workers’ living standards were still lower than before the Great Depression**
