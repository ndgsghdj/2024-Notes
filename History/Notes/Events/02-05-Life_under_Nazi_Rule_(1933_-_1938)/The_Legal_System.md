## The Legal System


- Judges
    - Had to belong to the Nazi-approved Nationalist Socialist League for the Maintenance of the Law
        - Created self-imposed control
            - Judges knew what they were expected to do and carried it out
- Courts
    - Trial by jury was abolished
        - Combined with the changes to judges, Nazi opponents rarely faced fair trials.
- Police
    - By 1936,
        - Police forces were controlled by regional governments
            - The regime made sure high-ranking Nazis headed these forces
        - Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the SS, was made the chief of police Germany
            - This effectively made the police a part of the SS
