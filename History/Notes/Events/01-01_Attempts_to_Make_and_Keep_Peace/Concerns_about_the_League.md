## Concerns about the League

 - Concerns by Britain and France
     * Lloyd George
         + Wanted a simpler organisation like the Conference of Ambassadors
             + Conference of Ambassadors
                 + Non-League organisation
                 + Informal meeting of the League's permanent members
             + Wanted to maintain Britain's ability to act independent of the League
     *  Clemenceau
         + Also wanted to maintain French independence to act
     *  Ability to achieve disarmament
         + The League expected members to disarm
         + However, this only worked if all members disarmed
         + If not, countries would be left themselves unable to protect their territories and interests
         + Members were thus resistant to disarm.
     *  Ability to stop aggressor countries
         + Peacekeeping Steps
             + A commission of enquiry determines if a nation was guilty of aggression
                 + __Concern:__ Takes time. Time that a country under attack might not have
             + Hold talks with the guilty party (Arbitration and use of moral persuasion)
                 + __Concern:__ Guilty party might not be open to persuasion and/or arbitration
             + League encourages members to impose economic sanctions collectively (thus cutting off trade ad financial relations)
                 + __Concern:__ Members might be concerned of the economic impact on their own countries
             + Take military action to protect them
                 + __Concern:__ The League had no army of its own.
     *  Membership of the League
         + Limited Membership
             + USA did not join because of its non-interventionist policy
                 + The League lacked the USA's economic and military support to enforce its will &rarr; Aggressor countries could continue to trade with US and did not fear one of the strongest militaries in the world
         + Germany denied from joining until 1926
         + USSR denied from joining until 1934
     *  All these thus greatly weakened the League
