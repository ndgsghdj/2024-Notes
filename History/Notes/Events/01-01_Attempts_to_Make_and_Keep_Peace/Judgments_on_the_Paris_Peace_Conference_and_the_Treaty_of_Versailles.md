## Judgments on the Paris Peace Conference and the Treaty of Versailles

### Was the Treaty of Versailles Too Harsh on Germany?

#### Yes

- Disarmament
    * Left it unable to protect itself
- Territorial
    * Brest-Litvosk was harsher to Russia than the TOV was on Germany &rarr; The Big 3 was kinder to Germany than it was to Russia
- War Guilt Clause
    * Unfair because Germany was only responding to Russian mobilisation when it did so at the start of WW1
- Reparations
    * Leads to hyperinflation in 1920s
    * Leads to greater suffering during the Great Depression
- Built resentment towards the Big 3
    * Rise of Hitler

#### No

- Leadership
    * Leadership was not removed/executed/tried &rarr; Experience (especially of military leaders) was retained
- Territorial
    * It is relatively characteristic of treaties of that time
        + But times had changed thanks to ideas like the 14 points and nationalism
            + Germans believed that it was too harsh
    * Germany was not split apart
