## Development of the Cold War, 1947-1955

### Introduction

- In this period, as their rivalry intensified, the United States and the USSR made a series of moves and countermoves, which increasingly contributed to a bipolar world.
- Bi-polarity in the Cold War context is often used to describe the division of Europe and the world during the Cold War, where the superpowers established competing blocs and spheres of influences

### The Truman Doctrine and Containment

#### Developments in Turkey and Greece

##### Greece

- It was occupied by the Germans in WWII.
- After the war, it was run by the British until a new government could be set up.
- Rival groups disagreed over how Greece would be run.
    * The Greek Communist Party wanted a communist state, while the Greek royalists wanted the return of the monarch.
- In 1946, a civil war broke out between the two sides.
    * The British did not have the resources to control the situation and announced their withdrawal on 24 February 1947.
    * Truman faced the prospect of yet another European country falling to communism

##### Turkey

- After WW2, Stalin tried to gain influence in Turkey. He wanted to get access to the __Turkish Straits__ so Soviet ships could sail from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea
- Truman's Concerns:
    * Turkey became an ally of the USSR, Stalin might use it as a stepping stone to spread communist influence in the Middle East.
    * Turkey was important to the United States because of its oil reserves

##### Back in USA

- To gain support in the United States, Truman exaggerated the scale of the threat in Greece and Turkey.
    * American newspapers, which supported Truman's policy of increasing US involvement in international affairs, aided his affairs.
- In May 1947, the US Congress passed the Greece and Turkey Aid Bill.
    * This was a package of US$400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey.
    * It secured Turkey as a US ally and propped up the monarchist government in Greece.
- However, by exaggerating the threat of the USSR, Truman probably worsened between Stalin and himself.
    * Stalin had actually kept his promise to Churchill in 1945 not to help the communists in Greece.

__Increasing Tensions Between the United States and the USSR__

- The Truman Doctrine made clear that the united States could not withdraw from World affairs as it had done after the WWI. Instead, it would actively resist the spread of communism.
- People were aware at the time that the doctrine would almost certainly lead to clashes between the United States and the USSR.
    * Sure enough, the announcement of the Truman Doctrine alarmed Stalin.

### The Marshall Plan

Truman wanted to use the United States' mighty economic power to prevent the spread of communism.
- He ordered US Secretary of State, George Marshall, to come up with a plan for economic aid.
- In June 1947, __the Marshall Plan__ was announced to the world.

__The Marshall Plan__

- The United States planned to put US$13 billion into helping Europe's shattered economies recover.
    * Starting in April 1948, food, machinery, animals and countless other items were shipped to democratic countries in Europe.
- Truman wanted people to get back to work and make money. He wanted them to feel good about capitalism, so they would not be attracted to communism.
- The Marshall Plan was widely seen by the United States' allies as an incredibly generous gesture and they were extremely grateful
- However, the United States was also looking after its own interests.
    * First, the United States needed Europe to recover so that its industries had a market to export their goods to.
    * Second, the largest amounts of financial aid from the Marshall Plan went to the United States' closest political allies, Britain and France.
    * Third, countries which did not have democratic, capitalist systems, did not receive such financial support.
        + For example, Italy did not receive any aid until a non-communist government took power in 1948.

#### Impact

- In economic terms, it brought a massive boost to Western Europe and brought about speedy recovery for the countries
    * E.g. Britain and France benefited, and so did war-ravaged West Germany, to the extent that West Germany enjoyed an "economic miracle" by the early 1950s.
- It helped to bind the United States and its allies closer together against communism.
- This worried Stalin, who then retaliated by creating two new organisations, the __Communist Information Bureau (Cominform)__ and the __Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon)__ with his Eastern European allies.
- It strengthened the division between the American-aligned Western Europe and the Soviet dominated Eastern Europe, thus contributing to tensions between the two superpowers.

#### Cominform and Comecon

##### Stalin's reaction to the Marshall Plan

- Stalin was appalled and angered by the Marshall Plan.
    - It seemed to him that the United States was trying to control Western Europe in the same way that the USSR was controlling Eastern Europe.
    - But to Stalin, the difference was that __the United States did not need a defensive buffer zone in the way the USSR did.__
- He was concerned that US domination of Western Europe was the first step was the first step for the United States to advance into Eastern Europe and threaten Soviet control there.
- In addition, Stalin wondered if Truman's involvement in Germany's quick recovery was due to the latter's intention to use Germany against the USSR.
- Stalin could do little about what was happening in Western Europe.
- Stalin tightened his grip on the Eastern European states and ordered them to have nothing to do with the Marshall Plan.
- Then he turned them into __satellite states__
    * Satellite states - a independent country that is under heavy political, economic and military control or influence from another country.
    * The USSR set up many satellite states in Eastern Europe so that the countries closest to it would be friendly to the USSR and form a buffer zone protecting it from Western Europe
- Stalin forced these new satellite states to stay close to the USSR.
    * He did this by creating two new organisations, the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon)

##### Cominform

- Set up in 1947, the Cominform published propaganda that would unite the communist states in Europe and ensured that satellite states implement a Soviet-style communism and trade mainly  with other Cominform countries.
- The members in Cominform included the leaders of the communist parties in Eastern Europe.
- Stalin used Cominform to tighten his control over the satellite states and ensure that the United States could not gain any political influence in them.
    * At Cominform meetings, Stalin told the Eastern European states which policies they should follow.
        + This included rejecting financial support from the Marshall Plan and cutting off trade and any other kind of contact with countries that did not belong to Cominform.
- There was no real debate within Cominform
    * The only state which argued with Stalin was Yugoslavia, led by Marshal Tito. Yugoslavia was expelled from Cominform in 1948.
    * There was a bitter, long-lasting feud between Tito and Stalin.

##### Comecon

- Set up in 1949 in response to the Marshall Plan
    * Stalin wanted to make sure the satellite states were free from any kind of control or influence from the United States.
- The idea was that Comecon members would trade mostly with one another rather than with the West.
    * The satellite states were promised benefits similar to the Marshall Plan.
    * In reality, Comecon favoured the USSR far more than any of its other members.
        + For example, Poland was forced to sell its coal to the USSR at one-tenth the price it could have sold on the open market.
- The creation of Cominform and Comecon in response to the Marshall Plan strengthened the division between the American-aligned Western Europe and the Soviet dominated Eastern Europe, thus contributing to the tensions between the two superpowers.
