## Impact of WW2 on Europe

### Introduction: At the end of WW2

- The United States and the USSR played important roles in defeating Germany in WW2.
- This cooperation was symbolised by __Elbe Day__.

#### Elbe Day

- On 25 April 1945, a US Army patrol moved into Torgau, a small German town on near Berlin on the banks of the River Elbe.
- Germany was close to defeat in WW2 by then. 
- The US commander became aware that there were Soviet troops on the other side of the river.
- He grabbed a US flag and waved it at them. The Soviet commander saw the flag and realised that the troops across the river were their American allies.
- The two forces met halfway on a damaged bridge across River Elbe and exchanged handshakes and gifts.
- This was publicised by newspapers and radio networks of the allies, which spread the news of the event.
- It also featured the camaraderie between the United States and the USSR far and wide.
- However, relations between the United States and the USSR started worsening after Germany's defeat as things quickly devolved into the __Cold War__

### Impact of WW2 on Europe: Europe in Ruins

- By the time Germany surrendered in May 1945, much of Europe was a devastated war zone.

#### Examples

| Type           | Description                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Casualties     | __36 million Europeans killed__                                                                                                                   |
| Infrastructure | - Roads, railways, bridges, canals __destroyed__ by fighting or bombing. </br> - __No gas, electricity, or running water__ in many areas </br> |
| Health         | __Disease and malnutrition__ were widespread, as there were desperate shortages of food and medicine                                       |
| Homelessness   | __Over 50 million people__ had lost their homes or had been forced to leave their homes                                                           |

This devastation led to difficulty in maintaining and restoring law and order and thus tensions between the USA and the USSR over how to deal with these problems.

This thus contributed to the outbreak of the cold war.

#### Situation in Eastern Europe

- Even more dire
    * Violence between ethnic groups where people killed one another for ethnic reasons.
    * Massive resistance in some areas towards USSR, which had come in and imposed themselves on the region.
- The situation in Eastern Europe would contribute to Cold War tensions as disagreements between the USA and the USSR over how to deal with these problems will arise.

### Decline of Western European Powers

- In 1939, there were three great European powers:
    * Britain
    * France
    * Germany
- By the end of the war, Britain had exhausted its resources during the war and had become virtually bankrupt despite never being invaded or defeated.
- In 1940, France was occupied by Germany. It was liberated in 1944 but was no longer the power it used to be.
- By 1945, Germany lay in ruins, after being defeated in WWII.

In a post-war Europe, Britain, France, and Germany were no longer dominant players on the world stage.
- This created a power vacuum that the USA and the USSR moved to fill, creating competition and tension between the two superpowers that contributed to the cold war.

### Emergence of New Superpowers

- In contrast, both the United States and the USSR emerged from the war as superpowers.

> The term "superpower" was first used in 1944 to describe the two countries being in a different league from the existing major powers.
> This was due to their geographical size and population, as well as the economic output and military strength they continued to possess after the war

Thus, as the USA and the USSR both emerged as superpowers in the wake of WW2, this created competition and tension between the two countries, contributing to the Cold War.
