## Continuing Tensions, 1949-1955

### The USSR and its Atomic Bomb

- In August 1949, the USSR successfully exploded its first atomic bomb.
- This meant that there was atomic parity with the United States
    * Atomic parity - Parity refers to the state of being equal. Thus, atomic parity means both superpowers had the ability to produce atomic bombs.
- This alarmed the Americans.
- This contributed to a __nuclear arms race__ between the two superpowers as they competed against each other for superiority in the development and accumulation of nuclear weapons.

### Communist Victory in China

- The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) defeated the Guomindang (GMD) in the Chinese Civil War, leading to a communist China in October 1949.
- While the United States was concerned about the implications of China turning communist, the Soviets were delighted.
- In February 1950, the two communist powers signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.
- The emergence of a new communist power that strengthened the communist bloc led by the Soviet Union heightened tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union.

### Outbreak of Korean War

- The Korean War was fought between North Korea and South Korea from 1950 to 1953.
    * The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea following years of hostilities between the two countries.
    * North Korea was supported by China and the Soviet Union while South Korea was supported by the United States and allied countries.
    * The fighting ended with an armistice on 27 July 1953.

#### Impact

- The Korean War was one of the first instances of a military conflict in the Cold War where both superpowers clashed but did not fight each other directly.
- The war led to the militarisation of NATO.
- This in turn led to the creation of the __Warsaw Pact__.
- The Korean War thus contributed towards the escalation of military tensions in Europe.

### The Warsaw Pact, 1955

- In 1955, West Germany was invited to join NATO, and rearmed.
    * This proved to be too much for the USSR.
        + Stalin had died in 1953, but East-West tensions remained.
        + The USSR believed that West Germany joining NATO was a threat.
- In response, the USSR created the Warsaw Pact in May 1955.
    * All the communist states in Eastern Europe, except Yugoslavia, became members.
    * All members agreed that if one state was threatened, they would help to defend it.

#### Impact - Entrenched Soviet Rule in Eastern Europe

- The Warsaw Pact entrenched Soviet rule in Eastern Europe Soviet troops, rather than the respective governments, were the ones that dealt with protests and uprisings in Eastern Europe.

##### Example

- On 4 November 1956, a nation-wide revolt in Hungary was forcefully quelled by Soviet tanks and troops.
    * Thousands were killed and injured, and nearly a quarter-million Hungarians fled its shores.
- Similarly, in protests in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Romania were crushed by Soviet forces.
- The Warsaw Pact sought to ensure that communist rule in Eastern Europe remained secure.
    - All the senior positions in the Warsaw Pact were held by Soviet officials and commands, not by anyone from the satellite states.
- Tensions between the superpowers and their respective set of allies increased because Europe was now divided into two armed camps.
- The Warsaw Pact strengthened the USSR because it gave the USSr command of all the armies of the satellite states.
- For the next 35 years, each side put much energy into plans to stop a possible invasion by the other side.
    * For example, thousands of US troops, tanks, aircraft and weapons were stationed in bases across Europe, particularly West Germany.
    * In return, the USSR and the other Warsaw Pact members trained their military forces, and stationed troops in each member's territory, in case NATO attacked.

Tensions between the superpowers and their respective set of allies increased because Europe was now divided into two armed camps.
