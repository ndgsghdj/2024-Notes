## Early Tensions Between the United States and the USSR

### Early Tensions: Competing Ideologies

Considering the history between the two countries and differences in ideology, it was surprising that there was even a wartime alliance between the United States and the USSR.

> Ideology - A set of beliefs or ideas, usually about politics and government, but it can be about economic and social issues as well.

From the very beginning of communist rule in the USSR, the United States and other democratic countries had opposed communism.

- This was because most politicians and business leaders in the United States hated and feared communist ideas. They felt that communism would threaten their way of life and had supported the Whites in the Russian Civil War against the establishment of communist rule in Russia.

On the other hand, the USSR believed that the United States was acting selfishly to build its own economic empire and political influence in the world.

Such perceptions resulted in mistrust and tensions between them, as well as competition, as each believed its ideology should be adopted by other countries, contributing to the outbreak of the cold war.

### Early Tensions: History of Suspicion and Mistrust before 1939

The United States and the USSR had a history of suspicion and mistrust going back to 1917, when Russia became a communist country.

#### Examples

- The USSR's vision called for worldwide communist revolutions to overthrow capitalist states. The United States and Western European democratic countries were alarmed, fearing that communism would spread in their countries and cause similar revolutions.
- At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, it was decided that Germany would not be broken up. The British and Americans were worried about the possibility of Russia becoming a communist country. They thought Germany could be a barrier to communism, highlighting their suspicion towards Russia.
- Between 1918 and 1921, a bitter civil war was fought in Russia between the communists and their opponents, known as the Whites. US and British troops intervened on the side of the Whites, hoping to prevent communist victory.
- In the 1920s, there was a Red Scare in the United States. The communist flag was red, so communists were often called "Reds". During the period of the Red Scare, there was widespread fear of everything and anything that might be associated with communism and communist-related activities in the United States.
    * This led to the US government to arrest and imprison many people, usually immigrants from Russia, accusing them of being communist agents. Most of those persecuted in this way are innocent.
- In the 1930s, the British and French had a policy of appeasement towards Hitler. To some extent, this policy was driven by the fear that the USSR was trying to spread communism by force. The British hoped that Hitler's Germany would oppose communism. To the USSR, appeasement threatened its security as it seemed to imply that Hitler was allowed to take over Eastern Europe.
- The USSR signed the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact with Germany in August 1939, promising not to attack each other. Such a pact surprised the United States and the world because earlier in the year, the USSR was in discussion with Britain and France about the formation of an alliance against Hitler. However, nothing had come out of that discussion.

This history of suspicion and mistrust between the USA and the USSR since the latter's founding created tensions between the two countries that contributed to the outbreak of the Cold War.

### Early Tensions: "Marriage of Convenience"

- Given the history of suspicion between the United States and the USSR, most historians believe the wartime alliance between Britain, the United States and the USSR was a "marriage of convenience".
- Britain, the United States and the USSR had formed their wartime alliance to win WWII by joining forces against a common enemy, Germany.
- However, tensions grew within the alliance even during the war

#### Example

- By August 1942, the Soviet troops had been fighting against a German invasion for more than a year. One of Stalin's major concerns was the immense pressure that his troops faced because of Germany's continuous attacks. He urged the United States and Britain to quickly open a second front in France to relieve this pressure and end the war as quickly as possible.
    * However, the United States and Britain only agreed to open the second front through Operation Overlord in 1944, when they met a year earlier in 1943 during the Tehran Conference in Iran.
    * Stalin felt that the Allies were delaying the opening of the second front to minimise their own losses and even weaken the USSR.
- This deepened his distrust of the United States and Britain.
    * In the Allies' defence, Churchill argued that any attempt to land troops in Western Europe would result in heavy casualties prior to 1944 as a large buildup of forces in Britain was first necessary to ensure success.
        + He therefore wanted a strategy of attacks along the edges of the Axis empire instead, beginning with North Africa and Italy, while preparations took place for the big invasion of northwest Europe.
            
The distrust between the USA and the USSR during their wartime alliance resulted in tensions between them, thus contributing to the outbreak of the Cold War.
