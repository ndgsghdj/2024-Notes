## Conclusion


- The events of 1947 to 1955 showed that bi-polarity had emerged as the post-war order.
    * The behaviours of the United States and the USSR showed that the two sides found it hard to see eye to eye on any issue as they did not trust each other.
    * Neither could accept that the other had a valid case or was acting responsibly or morally.
    * This was demonstrated by the formation of alliances like NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
- At the same time, it seemed that neither the United States nor the USSR really wanted to go to war with each other.
    * They were prepared to stir up trouble, criticise and support each other's enemies, but they usually found a way to avoid outright war.
    * A major reason was that both sides now had nuclear weapons and that the consequences of such a war were a lot more than traditional warfare.
    * However, the superpowers did get involved in major clashes. They got involved in what some considered as proxy wars.
        + A proxy war - In the Cold War context is a conflict where the superpowers do not fight directly against each other but provide arms, money and other types of support to the side which shares their political views.
