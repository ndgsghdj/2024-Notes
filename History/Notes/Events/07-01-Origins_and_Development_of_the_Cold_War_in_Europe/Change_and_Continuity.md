## Change and Continuity

> To what extent did foreign relations between the United States and the USSR change between 1922 and 1945?

On the surface, it seemed like the foreign relations changed for the better and relations improved quite suddenly overnight during the wartime alliance.

- However, this change was due to the change in circumstances where they were both facing the same enemy. A more cooperative relationship between the two, with a strategic alliance, was one that was necessary in order to have a higher chance of defeating Germany.

At a deeper level, the underlying reasons for their original poor relations remain the same.

- There was no opportunities for the two countries to come together to address or resolve their distrust and suspicion of each other.
- The ideological differences were simply put aside temporarily whilst they were too busy trying to defeat Germany during the war.

To conclude, foreign relations changed for the better but the change could be a __temporary__ one.

- The relationship might revert (i.e. poor relations) once the circumstances for change is removed (i.e. when they have no more common enemy or when war ends).
