## The Wartime Alliance Breaks Down: Yalta and Potsdam

### The Yalta Conference, Feb 1945

- By 1945, the defeat of the Axis powers was imminent. As superpowers, the United States and the USSR had a stake in the preliminary discussions that covered key post-war matters.
    * To facilitate this, the Big Three (Britain, the United States, and the USSR) met in February 1945 at the __Yalta Conference__ held in the city of Yalta, which was part of Soviet territory.
        + This was the first time they met since the Tehran Conference in November 1943
    * The United States and the USSR were dominating discussions as they had become the world's leading states.
        + However, the two countries had differing views about what should happen once the war ended.

|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| USA       | The USA believed in having peace, safety and prosperity in a post-war world. They believed that democracy and capitalism was a model for international development. It was also a means to gain political influence and benefit economically through trade. They also believed that the recovery of Western Europe was essential for international stability and US prosperity from trade. | This is because they were alarmed by the Soviet-supported communist parties in Eastern Europe who seemed to be making moves to seize power according to the ideas of the Communist Manifesto. Furthermore, trade with Europe was disrupted due to WWII. |
| USSR      | The USSR wanted to establish buffer states in Eastern Europe to prevent another invasion. They believed that Eastern Europe must remain friendly to the USSR for its own security, and wanted massive war reparations from Germany to repair its own economy and ensure that Germany could not threaten it again.                                                                             | This was because Russia was invaded by Germany twice through Poland. WWII also resulted in at least 20 million Soviet citizens dead and devastation of the USSR's industries and cities.                                                                    |

Despite their differences, the Big Three managed to agree on several important issues.

#### Examples of Agreements

- The USSR to enter the war against Japan once Germany surrendered.
- Germany to be divided into 4 zones: US, French, British and Soviet. Berlin (capital city), situated in the Soviet zone, was to be divided into 4 occupied zones too.
- Nazi war criminals responsible for the Holocaust to be tried before an international court.
- Countries liberated from German occupation to be allowed to hold free elections to choose the government they wanted.
- The Big Three to join the United Nations, a new organisation which aimed to keep peace after the war.
- Eastern Europe to be a Soviet sphere of influence as Stalin was concerned about the future security of the USSR in view of the wartime sufferings it had endured.

The Big Three, however, disagreed over the issue of __post-war Poland__. Nevertheless, they seemed to be able to negotiate and compromise with one another at that point in time.

#### Examples of Disagreements

- Stalin wanted the Soviet border to move westwards into Poland and argued that Poland, in turn, could move its border westwards into German territory.
    * Both Churchill and Roosevelt were unhappy about Stalin's plan.
    * Churchill persuaded Roosevelt to accept it as long as the USSR did not interfere in Greece where the British were trying to prevent a communist takeover.
    * Churchill's condition was also accepted by Stalin.

The leaders were careful to put up a united front as the Conference closed.

##### Examples

- They posed for publicity photographs (such as the one on the right) showing how friendly they were.
- They also issued declarations stressing their unity.

In reality, relations remained tensed even though there seemed to be agreement (and compromises) among the Allies at the Yalta Conference.

#### Examples

- Stalin and Churchill clashed on numerous issues. In comparison, Roosevelt seemed more willing and able to work with Stalin.
- Shortly after the Yalta Conference, Churchill wrote to Roosevelt and expressed his concerns that the USSR might jeopardise the free world.
- In May 1945, Churchill ordered his top military commanders to make plans for a possible future war against the USSR. Fortunately, that war never happened.

The tensions surfaced at the Yalta Conference due to the many unresolved issues was clear and contributed to the outbreak of the Cold War. However, that the Big Three were still able to come to agreements over important issues is a sign that tensions had yet to lead to a breakdown in their relationship.

### The Potsdam Conference, July-August 1945

- When the Big Three met again at the city of Potsdam, Germany, in July 1945, the war against Germany was over. The war against Japan was also coming to an end.
- There were other important changes in the world as well.

#### Change in Leadership

- The atmosphere in the Potsdam Conference was very different from the atmosphere of compromise during the previous conferences
- This was because while Stalin remained the leader of the USSR and continued to push his demands, the leaders of both the United States and Britain had changed.

##### The United States was now led by Harry S. Truman

- President Roosevelt had died in April 1945
- Truman did not have the same relationship with Stalin that Roosevelt had as he had assumed power after the wartime alliance between the USSR and the United States had broken down.
- In fact, he was concerned about the potential threat the USSR posed to the security of Western Europe and was thus determined to get tough and challenge Stalin on major issues.

##### In Britain, Churchill was replaced by Clement Attlee

- Churchill had lost the general election in July 1945 and was replaced by Clement Attlee halfway through the conference.
- He won the popular vote with his domestic policies as the British public saw him as a better peacetime prime minister than Churchill.
- He left the bulk of foreign policy and diplomacy to his Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin.
    * Bevin was strongly anti-communist and created policies that were closely aligned with Truman's anti-communist policies.
- Both Truman and Attlee were younger and less experienced in foreign affairs compared to their predecessors.

#### Increasing Soviet Control of Eastern Europe

Soviet troops now controlled most of Eastern Europe.

##### Examples

- The Red Army had liberated the countries of Eastern Europe from the Germans, but instead of withdrawing troops, Stalin had left them there.
- By July 1945, Stalin's troops effectively controlled the Baltic states, Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania
- In particular, Poland remained a source of tension among the Allies.
    * Stalin set up a communist government in Poland, ignoring the wishes of the majority of the Poles.
    * Britain and the United States protested, as they saw Stalin's actions to breaking agreements made during the Yalta Conference, which was to allow for free elections in Poland.
    * The British were concerned about the USSR's actions in Poland as they had gone to war over the country in 1939.
    * However, Stalin, driven by his desire for security insisted that his control of Eastern Europe was a defensive measure against possible future attacks.
- Besides Poland, he also encouraged communists in the other states to take power.

#### The Manhattan Project

- Since 1941, the United States had been secretly developing a new weapon to end the war - the atomic bomb.
    * This was part of a state-funded nuclear development programme called the Manhattan Project.
- The United States decided to keep it from the USSR until the Potsdam Conference in July 1945.
    * At the conference, Truman privately informed Stalin that the United States had successfully tested the atomic bomb.
    * Though Truman thought that he has caught Stalin unaware, the latter was not surprised when Truman told him about the bomb.
        + Information about the Manhattan Project had been leaked to the USSR earlier.
    * The United States' choice not to tell the USSR about the bomb earlier further deepened Stalin's suspicions towards the United States' intentions.

#### Disagreement over Germany

- Stalin wanted to cripple Germany completely.
    * Truman disagreed as he did not want to repeat the mistake of the Treaty of Versailles.
- Stalin also wanted compensation from Germany
    * Truman agreed at first, then changed his mind.
- Stalin thought Truman wanted to protect Germany and became suspicious of him.

#### Disagreement over Eastern Europe

- At the Yalta Conference, it was agreed that Eastern Europe would be a Soviet sphere of influence.
    * To Stalin, this meant he could set up communist governments loyal to him and keep them under close control.
- But this was much more than what Truman had in mind. He began to suspect Stalin of wanting to control all of Europe.

#### Summary

- As with the Yalta Conference, the newspapers, newsreels and radio broadcasts continued to stress the unity of the wartime allies at the Potsdam Conference.
- But with the changed circumstances and major disagreements, it was not surprising that the relations between the Big Three became increasingly tense.
    * Tensions that ultimately led to the outbreak of the Cold War

### Worsening Relations after Potsdam 

#### The Atomic Bomb

- Relations between the superpowers continued to worsen, especially after the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan and the post-war developments in Eastern Europe.
- When Truman told Stalin about the atomic bomb at Potsdam, it is likely that Truman was trying to intimidate him with this information
    * However, while this information might have concerned him, Stalin showed little reaction.
    * In fact, Stalin already knew about the atomic bomb from Soviet spies.
        + He did not react because he did not want to show Truman he was concerned.
        + Stalin had already ordered Soviet technicians and scientists to develop an atomic bomb before the Potsdam Conference.
- By 1949, both superpowers had atomic weapons.
- The acquisition of the atomic bomb by the Americans thus served to increase tensions between them and the Soviet Union, spurring them to develop the same capability and the outbreak of the Cold War

#### The Iron Curtain

- The issue of Eastern Europe had already caused tensions at the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences, and the situation continued to worsen.
    * This was due to Stalin's determination to control the governments of Eastern Europe to protect the USSR from future attacks.
- Although elections were held in the countries of Eastern Europe, Stalin adopted __"salami tactics"__ and removed political opponents one by one to make sure that communist governments led by politicians loyal to him took power across Eastern Europe
- Stalin succeeded
- The communist takeovers in the Eastern European countries were brutal at times.
    * The USSR would first support the establishment of coalition governments in Eastern European countries where the local communist party was influential.
    * The communists would work with other parties at the beginning.
    * But gradually, they would take control by isolating and suppressing other parties in the coalition.
    * These parties would be banned, and their leaders arrested and exiled. In some cases, they were beaten or even murdered.
    * By "slicing" the opposition bit by bit, Soviet control over Eastern Europe was achieved through Stalin's salami tactics

##### Example

- Jan Masaryk, a Czechoslovak diplomat and politician. Masaryk believed passionately in democracy.
- He was an intelligent and popular politician, and he defeated the communists in several elections.
- His phone was tapped and he was followed by Soviet agents.
- In September 1947, his enemies tried to kill him with a bomb sent in a parcel.
- In March 1948, he was found dead below his bedroom window.
- The official verdict was suicide, but most historians think he was murdered.

The differing views on Soviet control of Eastern Europe:

| To Stalin / USSR | To Truman / United States |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Controlling Eastern Europe made sense as it was the traditional route through which enemies from the West attacked Russia. If he controlled the region by creating more buffer states, it would be more challenging for others to invade the USSR through it. | Stalin's actions were evidence that he was building an empire, but many people in the United States were weary of conflict. They were wary of dragging the United States into international politics. They argued that Stalin's actions were none of their concern. |

#### The Iron Curtain Speech

To combat the wariness of conflict felt by the American people, Truman turned to Churchill for help.
- While Churchill was no longer Britain's Prime Minister, he was still highly respected, especially in the United States.
- Truman arranged for him to give a speech at Fulton, Missouri, in March 1946 and approved the speech in advance.
- In the speech, Churchill warned of the dangers of the USSR and first used the term "the Iron Curtain".
    * He stressed the necessity for the United states and Britain to act as the guardians of peace and stability against the menace of Soviet communism, which had lowered an "iron curtain" across Europe.
    * The term "iron curtain" refers specifically to the political, military and ideological barrier created by the USSR following WWII to prevent open contact between itself and its Eastern European allies on the one hand, and the West and other non-communist regions on the other.
- The Iron Curtain speech had a huge impact.
    * It alarmed many Americans and got Truman the attention and support he wanted in getting the United States more involved in international affairs.
    * The speech also drew angry responses from the Soviet media and from Stalin himself.

Due to differing views on Soviet control of Eastern Europe and the provocative Iron Curtain speech, tensions between the USA and the Soviets were heightened thus contributing to the outbreak of the Cold War.
