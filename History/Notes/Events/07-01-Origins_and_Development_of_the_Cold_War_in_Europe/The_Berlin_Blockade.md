## The Berlin Blockade


### Escalation of Tensions


- The brewing tensions between the United States and the USSR would lead to a big clash over the issue of what to do with Germany.
- Germany was divided into four zones of occupation after the war. Berlin, situated within the Soviet Zone, was also divided into four zones.
    * This implementation of the four zones of occupation in Germany took reference from the __Morgenthau Plan__, drawn up by the United States in 1944.
    * The plan involved breaking up Germany and dismantling its industries so that it would never be strong enough to wage war again.
- With the increasing tensions between East and West from 1945 onwards, Truman began to see Germany as a possible future ally against the USSR.
    * The British and French were also keen for Germany to start rebuilding its economy, as controlling their respective zones was a drain on resources.
- In early 1948, the United States, France and Britain combined their zones into a single economic unit known as the Trizone.
    * A new currency was also introduced.
    * To Stalin, this action seemed like the United States was rebuilding his old enemy.
        + He could not stop the Allies, but he thought he could make a point by forcing them out of Berlin.
- In June 1948, Stalin responded by carrying out a blockade of West Berlin, during which the USSR cut the rail and road links from the Allied zones into West Berlin.
    * This was known as the __Berlin Blockade__
        + He also disrupted water and power supplies.
        + It seemed like a clever scheme on Stalin's part as the people there would suffer if the Allies stayed in Berlin.
- Truman was not prepared to be driven out of Berlin.
- To counter the blockade, Truman ordered an airlift.
    * For almost a year, the United States and its allies supplied West Berlin with coal, food and medicine by air.
    * One plane reached West Berlin every 30 seconds at the height of the airlift.
    * This was known as the __Berlin Airlift__
    * Western media praised the courage and endurance of the air crews.
        + While the Soviet media criticised the constant flights as unsafe, the USSR did not prevent the airlift.
- By May 1949, the blockade was clearly not driving the United States out of Berlin, so Stalin eventually gave up and lifted it.

### Consequences


#### The Creation of East Germany, 1949


- In May 1949, soon after the blockade, Truman announced that the British, French and US zones would be united to create the __Federal Republic of Germany,__ or __West Germany.__
- Soon afterwards, in October 1949, Stalin announced that the Soviet zone would become the __German Democratic Republic, or East Germany.__
- __Berlin was also divided into East and West Berlin__
    * The division of Berlin would later take the form of a concrete wall dividing East and West, known as the Berlin Wall.
    * The Berlin Wall became one of the key symbols of the Cold War, separating the communist East and democratic West

#### The Creation of NATO, 1949


- At the height of the Berlin Blockade, the Western powers met in Washington D.C. and signed the agreement to work together.
    * This resulted in the __North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)__ in April 1949.
- While there were many parts to the treaty, the most important was that all NATO members agreed to go to war if any member was attacked.
    * NATO countries could provide US forces with secure bases in Europe.
    * Truman wanted to make it clear to Stalin that the United States would intervene in Western Europe, if necessary.
- Reactions
    * US allies such as Britain, were happy to have US forces in Western Europe as it guaranteed their protection from a possible Soviet attack.
    * Not surprisingly, the USSR did not see the alliance in the same way.
        + They saw it as a threat by the Western powers that split the world into two military blocs.

It made clear that there was a new reality: Europe was now divided into two camps, Western Europe and the United States versus Eastern Europe and the USSR
