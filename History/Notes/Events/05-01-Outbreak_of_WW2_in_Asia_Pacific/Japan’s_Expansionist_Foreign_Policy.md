## Japan’s Expansionist Foreign Policy

### Rise of Japanese Militarism

- Tensions between civilian politicians and military leaders worsened as the ultranationalist military commanders (which many of them were) grew in influence thanks to the military victories in the early 1900s
- Ultranationalist military commanders believed…
    - Military service was an honor and noble calling
    - Many of them believe that Japan’s destiny was to remove the Western powers from Asia and expand its rule over it
- Such beliefs became extremely popular, especially after the annexation of Manchuria
- On the other hand, the civilian politicians increasingly lost the trust of the people who they saw it as weak
- By 1936, the military was effectively in control of Japan

### Japan and the Western Powers

- From the Meiji period till the 1930s, Japan had used propaganda to encourage…
    - A strong sense of nationalist pride
    - Wariness towards foreigners, especially the colonial powers
- **The Japanese saw Britain, Russia/USSR, and the US as rivals and obstacles to its ambitions**
    - **US:**
        - **Seen to have** already turned against them with its economic policies against Japan in the 1930s as they had left 1000s of Japanese workers in unemployment when it stopped importing Japanese goods
        - Banned Asian workers from moving to the USA.

    - **Britain:**
        - Cooperated under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, 1902-1923 to prevent the USSR from advancing in the Far East
        - But by the 1930s, the relationship had deteriorated
            - British criticised Japan over the invasion of Manchuria
            - Britain was on friendly terms with the US who was increasingly in conflict with Japan
            - Japan increasingly seen as a rival power
                - British controlled colonies throughout Asia such as Hong Kong and Malaya

    - **USSR:**
        - Communism was against rule by an Emperor
            - Japanese believed in loyalty to their Emperor
        - Japan saw Communism as a ideology to be combated
        - USSR border had a border with the Japanese Empire in Manchuria
            - E.g. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Italy and Germany
        - Fear of USSR served to further motivate Japan to expand into Asia
            - Wanted more buffer territories against the USSR
            - Gain resources for a potential fight against the USSR

### The Great Depression and Japan’s Search for Self-Sufficiency

- The Great Depression damaged Japan’s economy due to its heavy reliance on foreign trade, which led to major political implications
    - The terrible unemployment and the other effects of the Depression increased the pressure on the civilian politicians
        - The economic crisis convinced the ultranationalist politicians and military commanders that democracy was failing as it could not solve the people’s problem
    - The introduction of a range of tariffs by the US in the 1930s to protect its own economy, terribly hurt Japan’s export trade
        - Examples
            - Electric light bulbs = 25%
            - Fish = 50% tariffs
            - Clothing = 75% tariffs
        - **US actions convinced the ultranationalists that other countries could not be relied upon and that Japan needed to be self-sufficient**
