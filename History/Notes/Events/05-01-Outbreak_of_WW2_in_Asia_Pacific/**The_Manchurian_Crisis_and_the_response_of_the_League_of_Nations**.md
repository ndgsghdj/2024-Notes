## **The Manchurian Crisis and the response of the League of Nations**

### Japanese Public Opinion

- With the changes in domestic politics, worsening relations with the Western powers and the economic problems, Japan began to see building an empire as a means to protect their economy.
    - For the great majority of these commanders and politicians, the obvious place for Japan to expand was through the conquest of China’s territory, particularly in Manchuria.
- By 1931, the idea that influence and control should be extended over Manchuria had gained a lot of ground in Japan.
    - Manchuria was rich in coal and iron and was seen as the perfect solution to Japan’s lack of natural resources.
- Such opinions even extended to civilian politician with moderate views
    - E.g. Shidehara Kijuro, Foreign Minister in 1931
        - had taken part in the negotiations to limit arms and was a firm supporter of the League of Nations
        - Even he believed that it was right and justifiable for Japan to expand into Manchuria

### Instability in China

- This view of extending control to Manchuria was strengthened by what was happening in China.
    - At that point in time, China was ruled by the Chinese Nationalist Party, also known as Guomindang (GMD, also known as Kuomintang) under Chiang Kai-shek.
        - Chiang faced serious threats to his rule. On the borders with Manchuria, many local warlords did not fully accept his authority.
            - Some were prepared to collaborate with the Japanese in return for economic and military support.
    - At the same time, Chiang was locked in an intense rivalry with the small but growing Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
        - China’s troubles and instability seemed to provide the perfect opportunity for Japan

### Conquest of Manchuria

- These views became reality in **September 1931**. Ishiwara’s (a ultranationalist colonel in the Kwantung Army, who believed Japan should rule Manchuria) forces blew up part of a railway track at Mukden (known as the Mukden Incident).
- Japan blamed the explosion on the Chinese government and used it as an excuse to take over Manchuria.
- **By December they controlled most of the region.**
- There was very little opposition in Japan to the invasion and the military commanders felt encouraged to continue.
    - In February 1932, they set up a puppet government in Manchuria, Manchukuo
    - Later in 1932, Japanese aeroplanes and gunships moved down south and bombed Shanghai.
        - The civilian government in Japan ordered the army to withdraw, but was ignored.
        - This signalled that the army, not the government, was assuming control of Japanese foreign policy.

### Response of the League of Nations

- When Japan invaded Manchuria, China appealed to the League of Nations for international support.
    - In October 1931, the League’s Council passed a resolution by 13 votes to 1 calling on Japan to withdraw its troops.
        - The only vote against the resolution, unsurprisingly, was cast by Japan.
        - The Japanese claimed they were not invading China, but simply acting in self-defence to keep peace since China was in a state of anarchy.
- A commission was sent by the League to Manchuria to evaluate Japan’s actions
- The League presented the Lytton Report ([further reading](https://digitalrepository.trincoll.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1083&context=moore)) on the Manchurian Incident a year after the invasion.
    - The conclusion was clear – Japan had acted unlawfully and Manchuria should be returned to the Chinese.
- In February 1933, instead of withdrawing from Manchuria, the Japanese announced they intended to occupy more of China.
    - They maintained that this was necessary to defend their territories.
- On 24 February, the Lytton Report was approved by 42 votes to 1 in the League’s General Assembly.
    - Again, only Japan voted against it.
    - **Japan rejected the Lytton Report and withdrew from the League on 27 March.**
- The League’s economic sanctions were powerless without the support of the United States, Japan’s main trading partner.
    - Britain also did not sanction Japan as it seemed more interested in maintaining a good relationship with Japan.
    - The League could not ban arms sales to Japan because the member countries could not agree on that.
        - They were worried that Japan would retaliate, and escalate the situation.
- Britain and France would not risk their navies or armies in a war to stop Japan.
    - Only the United States and the USSR would have had the resources to remove the Japanese from Manchuria by force, but they were not League members.
    - The USSR even sold a railway line in northern Manchuria to the Japanese.

### Consequences of the Manchurian Crisis

**International Relations**

- It tarnished the prestige of the League.
    - It demonstrated that the League was helpless in the face of aggressor nations such as Japan.
    - It undermined the confidence of League officials to tackle future crises.
- It encouraged Japan to further expand into Asia in the following years as Manchuria’s location placed it in a strong position for expansion into China.
- The Manchurian Crisis was important in the events leading up to war in the Asia-Pacific.
    - Japan now had access to the raw materials and resources available in Manchuria needed for its growing industries.

**Japanese Politics**

- The annexation of Manchuria was extremely popular in Japan as many of them saw Manchuria as a solution to Japan’s economic problems.
- This increased the prominence and influence of the ultranationalists and military and resulted in the weakening of democratic politics in Japan.
    - The military continued to challenge the civilian politicians’ authority, and gained more positions of power and influence in the government by 1932.
- From this point, Japanese policies were increasingly driven by ideas which promoted expansion.
