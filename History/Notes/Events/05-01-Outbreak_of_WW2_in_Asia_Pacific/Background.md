## Background

### Asia and the Western Powers

- From about 1700, the Western European powers (especially Britain, France, and the Netherlands) embarked on a phase of colonisation in Asia
- By the mid-1800s…
    - Britain controlled India
    - The Netherlands and France had trading posts, military bases and colonies in Asia
    - They and the USA began eyeing China for its untapped economic potential

### The Modernisation of Japan

- To avoid being exploited like other Asian countries, Japan began a programme of modernisation in 1868 known as the Meiji Restoration
    - Introduced a new Meiji Constitution
        - Provided a limited form of democracy
        - Kept the Emperor in charge
    - Japan’s industry underwent rapid expansion
    - Quickly transformed Japan into an important Asian power by the early 1900s.
- Gained military might which allowed Japan to win…
    - 1894-1895: 1st Sino-Japanese War
    - 1904-1905: Russo-Japanese War
    - Result…
        - Annexed Korea and gained control over parts of Manchuria
- Developed alliance with Britain
    - Guarded its territories in WW1 in the 1920s.
- **Japan was a well-respected on the international stage**
    - Full member of the League of Nations
    - Participant in the post-WW1 disarmament process.
- In 1921, Japan signed the **Washington Naval Treaty**
    - All signatories agreed to the ratio for warship tonnage to be:
        - United States: 5
        - Britain: 5
        - Japan: 3
        - Italy: 1.75
        - France: 1.75
    - Japan had to reduce their naval strength more than the USA and Britain.
        - Many Japanese saw this as an unfair treaty
        - Fueled desire by Japan to establish itself as an equal to the West.
- At the same time, signed trade deals with Britain and the USA and expanded trade with the rest of Asia

### Japan’s Ambition

- Japan wanted to be an equal with the Western powers that had empires
- As a result, **ultranationalism** began to grow within Japan
    - Examples
        - Approved conquest of Korea in 1910
        - Supported the idea of Japan expanding its empire
    - These beliefs were driven by Japan’s natural limitations
        - Japan is covered by high mountains
            - Had little land to grow food to feed its rapidly growing population
        - Japan did not have raw materials such as iron ore and coal
        - In the 1920s, Japan depended on importing raw materials and food from China
- As a result of its limitations, many ultranationalists argued that Japan had to expand to get access to the raw materials that a modern nation needed

### Divide between Civilian Politicians and Military Leaders

- From the early to mid-1920s, the more moderate civilian politicians was in control
    - They preferred to advance Japanese interests by peaceful means (e.g. trade and int’l cooperation)
    - They also cut the military budget
        - Angered military leaders that it showed a lack of respect for the military
- Military leaders believed that other countries could not be trusted
    - They also believed that a war between Japan and the Western powers was inevitable
