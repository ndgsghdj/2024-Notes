## Japan-US Relations


### **Different Considerations of the United States about Japan’s Potential Threat**


**Sources of tension**

- As a result of the Great Depression, the United States introduced a range of tariffs in 1930 to protect its own economy.
- In 1937, tensions between Japan and the United States rose with Japan’s invasion of China.
    - The United States condemned Japan’s actions and provided financial and military aid to the Chinese leader, Chiang Kai-shek.

**Dilemma faced by the US**

- On one hand…
    - The United States disapproved of Japan’s expansionist actions and imposed economic sanctions.
    - Japan was both an military, economic and political rival that challenged its interests in Asia-Pacific.
        - **Military:** Japan’s powerful navy competed with the US for control of the Pacific
        - **Economic:** Japanese companies competed with US companies to sell goods in Asian markets
        - **Political:** Japanese views about keeping Asia for Asians threatened US interests in Asia
- On the other hand…
    - Japan was strongly anti-communist and would be able to help the United States to hold back the spread of communism in Asia.
    - After the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, the US was wary of upsetting Japan and pushing it closer to Germany and the USSR

### **US Economic War on Japan**


- The 1937 invasion of China prompted the US government to take a progressively harder line on Japan.
    - President Roosevelt was worried about Japan’s growing ambitions and wanted to keep its expansion in check.
    - Thus, he announced a series of financial and economic measures designed to halt Japan’s aggressive foreign policy.
- The initial sanctions by the United States proved to be ineffective.
    - Japan subsequently occupied French Indochina in 1940.
        - This was an attempt by Japan to gain an inroad into Southeast Asia to obtain resources to continue its war efforts against China.
        - In response, an embargo was placed on raw materials such as steel and iron in October 1940.
- After the failure of negotiations between the United States and Japan, and Japan's refusal to withdraw from China and Indochina, an oil embargo was imposed in August 1941.
    - Roosevelt resurrected a law from WWI - 'Trading with the Enemy Act', which seized Japanese assets in the United States, making it unable to buy essential goods.
- The United States policy was an attempt to strangle Japan financially.
    - Roosevelt’s measures would cut off almost 90% of Japan’s oil supplies.
        - This was damaging for a modern economy
        - For a modern army, air force and navy, this was crippling; ships, planes and tanks were useless without fuel.
- The United States demanded that Japanese troops withdraw from China and promise not to threaten any territories belonging to the United States or its allies (particularly Britain)

### **Japan’s Dilemma over the United States**


- The US demands were completely unacceptable to the Japanese.
    - It would mean Japan could be bullied and intimidated by the United States.
    - But the only alternative seemed to be a conflict with the United States.
        - The United States was an economic giant.
        - Its resources were estimated to be six times greater than Japan’s.
        - Accounts from the time show the different perspectives of leading Japanese politicians and military commanders with regard to engaging the United States in a war.

### Japan’s Response


**Background**

- Japan’s leaders gambled that they could take on the United States.

**The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere**

- The first stage was to develop Japan’s empire in the hope of rivalling US economic strength.
- In 1940, Japan launched a programme called the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.
    - Aimed primarily at the people in the various Asian territories which Japan controlled.
    - The emphasis was on the goal of ridding Asia of the influence of the United States and other Western powers.
    - The message was that the people of Asia should unite behind Japan, which would lead this campaign to drive foreigners out of Asia, and that Japan would protect the people of Asia and rule them fairly as a fellow Asian country.
