## **Japanese aggression towards China, 1933-1940**

### **Extension of Japanese Influence in the Region**

- Encouraged by the success of Manchuria, Japan soon sought to extend its power and influence in the region.
- The death of GMD founder Sun Yat-sen in 1925 escalated the conflict between the GMD and the CCP.
    - This infighting created a great deal of instability in China, which the Japanese were keen to exploit to their own advantage.
- They came up with a strategy of getting their warlord allies to stir up trouble in a region and then invite the Japanese troops in to restore order.
    - It was not long before this led to an all-out war.

- These events were advantageous from Japan’s point of view.
