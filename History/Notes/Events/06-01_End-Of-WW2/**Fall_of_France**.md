## **Fall of France**

- In May 1940, the Germans attacked France.
    - The French had a larger army and air force
    - They were further supported by the British Expeditionary Force and Royal Air Force (RAF).
    - Despite this, the French were unable to resist German attack.
- By late May, the British and French were surrounded and facing total defeat.
    - They retreated to the Channel coast in the region around the port of Dunkirk. The Allied armies were highly vulnerable and could have been destroyed.
    - However, some of Hitlerâ€™s generals felt that there was a need to slow down to consolidate the German forces to not leave themselves vulnerable to attacks. Thus, Hitler ordered the German forces to stop.
- France surrendered and fell into the hands of Germany in June. It was a massive victory for Germany and revenge for its defeat in 1918.
    - Hitler was delighted when he heard the news of the victory as he had previously fought in the German army against the French during WWI.
