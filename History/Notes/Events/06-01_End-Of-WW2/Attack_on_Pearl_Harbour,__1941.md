## Attack on Pearl Harbour,  1941


- Japan attacked Pearl Harbour in 1941:
    - It was a devastating attack that ended in near total success for the Japanese
    - US intelligence failed to warn the US forces, and Japanese planes from aircraft carriers achieved almost complete surprise against the American forces.
- The attack lasted around 90 minutes
    - 2000 military personnel lost
- Three days after Pearl Harbour, Japanese forces sank the most powerful British battleships in the Pacific region, the Prince of Wales and the Repulse.
    - As a result…
        - “There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific. Over this vast expanse of waters, Japan was supreme and everywhere we were weak and naked.”
- However, in the long run, Pearl Harbour did not prove to be as decisive as the Japanese thought
    - The United States was able to recover quickly within a few months and retaliate against Japan
        - The outrage over the surprise attack allowed US President Roosevelt to rally the country. The United States was now probably more united and organised than it has ever been to declare war on Japan.
        - Now the country’s huge resources were directed towards the war
            - E.g. The US shipyards quickly constructed new ships, especially aircraft carriers
    - On a tactical level, there was also some comfort for the US navy, as its aircraft carriers during the attack.
        - Japan had made a massive error: they failed to hunt down and destroy the carriers, which the United States continued to use throughout 1942.
        - This meant that Japan did not gain control of the Pacific as they had hoped.
