## Defeat of Japan and the Atomic Bomb


### Island-hopping


- After the battle of Midway, the United States and its allies gradually drove the Japanese back across the Pacific from the territories they had taken. They used a strategy known as **island-hopping**
    - The US island-hopping strategy led to several key victories between 1942 and 1945, such as in the battle to regain the Philippines, which continued to weaken the Japanese military
    - Japan’s resources became severely overstretched and it was not able to defend the entire empire.
    - The Japanese fought fanatically for each island in the Pacific and each territory in China and Burma
    - Soon, the war reached a pivotal stage in 1945, with US air raids on Japanese soil, such as the bombing of Tokyo.
- In April 1945 British and US forces took the island of Okinawa
    - The Allies had to kill or capture every one of the 100,000 Japanese soldiers defending the island - none of them would surrender
    - Allied ships had also been badly damaged by Japanese kamikaze suicide bombers, who crashed their planes deliberately into them.
    - These attacks were used as a last resort by the Japanese
    - Although Japan was being pushed back, it came at great cost for the Allies

### The Atomic Bombings, August 1945


- By May 1945, the United States was confident of winning the war eventually.
    - Nonetheless, after Roosevelt’s death in April 1945, the new president, Harry Truman, was faced with the prospect of a year or more of heavy casualties. US troops would have to beat back the Japanese island by island, and then invade Japan itself.
    - However, there was an alternative. An international team of scientists in the United States, working on what was known as the Manhattan Project, had just perfected the world’s first atomic bomb
- In the end, Truman decided to use the bombs without warning.
    - He accepted military advice to drop two bombs in quick succession. This was to convince the Japanese that the United States had a large stockpile of the weapons, which it did not.
- On 6 August 1945, the American bomber, Enola Gay, dropped a five-ton atomic bomb, nicknamed “Little Boy” over the city of Hiroshima
- On 9 August 1945, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb, nicknamed "Fat Man", over the city of Nagasaki.
- Both instances of dropping the atomic bombs caused appalling damage and horrific casualties, and reduced the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to ruins.
    - They also left a legacy of cancer and other radiation-related diseases among the survivors.

| Total Population     | 255,000   | 195,000  |
| Dead                 | 66,000    | 39,000   |

| **Total Casualties** | 135,000   | 64,000   |

- Japanese Emperor Hirohito and most of his government told the army to surrender after the Nagasaki bomb.
    - However, some of the military leaders disagreed with the Emperor's proposed actions and attempted to overthrow the Emperor and continue the war instead.
        - This proved to many people on the Allied side that the decision to use the bombs was right.
    - The Emperor's will prevailed, and Japan surrendered on <u>14 August 1945</u>. 

# Historical Interpretations

- Historians can have different interpretations of the past, even though they may be examining the same historical event or period.
- **Factors can Explain Differences in Historical Interpretations**
    - These factors include:
        - Differences in the questions historians ask about the past
        - The different sources that historians can draw upon to help them reach their interpretations and
        - Differences in the way historians make sense and meaning of the past
- To make sense of differing interpretations and decide which are acceptable, and which one we prefer, you can consider the following:
    - What claims are being made in the interpretations?
    - What evidence is being used to support these claims?
    - What the context in which these interpretations were made is?

# Overview of the War
- Most historians looking back at WWII tend to agree on the broad picture of the war.
    - Germany, Japan and Italy were important nations, but they were not as strong as the leading powers - Great Britain, the USSR and above all, the United States.
    - The Allies not only and superior resources but also managed to mobilise and utilise them in a manner suited to help them win the war.
- While the Axis powers were seemingly successful at the start of WWII, they did not have the capability both militarily and economically to fight a prolonged war.
