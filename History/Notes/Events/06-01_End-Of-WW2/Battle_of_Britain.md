## Battle of Britain

- Having defeated France, Hitler turned his attention to Britain.
- The German air force (Luftwaffe) carried out large-scale attacks against Britain’s RAF to achieve air superiority.
- This lasted from September 1940 to May 1941, although bombing continued throughout the war.
    - The Germans later turned to British cities, bombing them in a campaign known as the Blitz.
- The Blitz caused huge losses of life and great damage to houses, docks, warehouses and factories.
    - Despite the losses, the British kept a grim willingness to carry on with the war effort and did not surrender to the Germans.

# Operation Barbarossa, 1941

- Hitler and Stalin had signed the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in August 1939, agreeing not to go to war and to split Poland between the two of them.
    - However, this agreement would not last.
        - Hitler had always wanted to destroy communism and expand Germany’s territory into Eastern Europe and the USSR.
        - Occupying the USSR would also give Germany access to the USSR’s vast resources such as oil.
- In June 1941, Germany launched Operation Barbarossa.
- Initially, Germany seemed successful. Stalin was on the verge of abandoning Moscow in September 1941.
- However, the Germans were not able to overwhelm the USSR fast enough, and the harsh winter halted the German advance.
    - Stalin used that time to reorganise the Soviet war effort.
    - Coupled with the extensive resources provided by the US Lend-Lease scheme, the reorganisation enabled the USSR to turn around and put up a strong resistance against the Germans on the Eastern Front.
    - E.g. Around 90 percent of German casualties in WWII were on the Eastern Front against the USSR.

# **Operation Overlord: D-Day, 1944**

- As the Germans and the Soviets were engaged in various major battles, the Allies sought to liberate France.
    - However, the Germans had been in France since 1940 and had strong fortifications. i.e. [the Atlantic Wall](https://www.britannica.com/place/Atlantic-Wall)
- It was a high-risk undertaking, but the start of Operation Overlord, also known as D-Day, was nonetheless fixed for 6 June 1944.
    - On this day, the combined Allied forces landed on the heavily fortified coasts of France’s Normandy region.

# Strengths of the Allies

# Victory in Europe

- By 1944, it was clear that Germany was on verge of losing the war in Europe.
    - The Soviets were able to stop the German advance, and they also reversed their fortunes with a huge victory in Stalingrad in early 1943.
    - Operation Overlord had opened a second front that Germany could ill afford
- Although Germany fought back hard
    - E.g. They carried out a counterattack in December 1944 through the Ardennes Forest (located in the southeast of Belgium), they were steadily driven back.
    - E.g. They put some remarkable new equipment into action, including guided missiles and jet aircraft, but none of them could stop the Allies’ advance.
- The Germans were forced to retreat, and by January 1945, the Soviet troops had encircled Berlin.
    - Hitler withdrew to his underground bunker, where he continued meeting his military generals and close subordinates such as Goering, Himmler and Goebbels to give orders to them.
- On 30 April 1945, facing imminent defeat by the Allies, Hitler committed suicide.
- After much fighting, the US and British forces met up with Soviet forces at the River Elbe in Germany, and the war in Europe was over when Germany formally surrendered on 8 May 1945.

# Turning Points in History

**A Why to Weigh Factors**

- A turning point in History would involve a shift in the nature of change. This could be in terms of the:
    - **Pace of Change:** things could start developing at a much faster pace, or slow down to a crawl; or
    - **Direction of Change:** developments could shift from mostly negative to mostly positive, or vice versa, for example.
