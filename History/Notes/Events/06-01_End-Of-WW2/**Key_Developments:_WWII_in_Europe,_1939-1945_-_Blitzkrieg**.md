## **Key Developments: WWII in Europe, 1939-1945 - Blitzkrieg**


- Germany quickly extended its control into Europe in the early phases of the war
    - E.g. Shortly after occupying Poland, Germany invaded and occupied Norway, Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands and France by 1940.
- This was largely due to its successful use of blitzkrieg, which means “lightning war”.
    - Blitzkrieg was a swift and focused attack using mobile forces, such as armoured tanks and air support, to overwhelm the enemies
- Germany used blitzkrieg tactics because its economy lacked important resources such as copper, rubber and oil, and could not support long drawn-out campaigns, military stalemates and trench warfare.
    - In trench warfare, troops attack and defend from trenches that are dug into the ground. This type of warfare often resulted in stalemates between both sides, which would prolong the war and lead to a high number of deaths.
- While blitzkrieg brought Germany a lot of initial success, the situation would change.
