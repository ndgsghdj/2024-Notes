## Growth in Support for the Nazis

While the communists gained supporters from the economic crisis, the Nazis gained even more

- By 1933, membership rose to >800,000
- In the 1930 elections, the Nazi got 107 seats

This was due to a number of factors

1. The Hitler Factor

    2. His profile was raised by his failed presidential campaign against Hindenburg in 1932.

        2. He travelled by plane on a hectic tour of rallies across Germany

    1. At the time, there were frequent street battles
