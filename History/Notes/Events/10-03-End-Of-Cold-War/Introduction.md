## Introduction

- Through the 1950s and 1960s, the Cold War was characterised by a series of crises and confrontations.
    - In that time, the United States and the USSR never quite took that fatal step of fighting a direct war with each other.
    - However, both sides - and indeed the rest of the world - lived in constant fear of this possibility, especially one that involved nuclear weapons
- As a result, by the late 1960s, the two sides were exploring ways to reduce tensions through __Detente__
    - They tried to improve relations and even cooperate in areas such as arms reduction and trade
        - This process became known as detente, a French word that means "easing of tensions"
        - The key mover of detente was US President Richard Nixon

- Although relations improved during the detente period, it did not last because of:
    - Too many areas of disagreement between the United States and the USSR
    - Too much pressure exerted on both countries
- Internal political rivalries in the United States led several presidents, especially Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, to adopt tougher approaches towards the USSR.
