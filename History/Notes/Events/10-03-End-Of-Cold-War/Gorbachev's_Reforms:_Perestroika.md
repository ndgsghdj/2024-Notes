## Gorbachev's Reforms: Perestroika

### Examples and Explanation

In 1985, the USSR elected 54-year-old Mikhail Gorbachev to be its leader. Gorbachev was aware of the terrible problems facing the USSR and introduced a series of radical measures to reform it. One of these reforms was the policy of Perestroika ("restructuring"). It was a series of political and economic reforms that was intended to encourage new ideas, to increase efficiency and to fight the problem of corruption. One such measure in 1987 saw Perestroika allow market forces to be introduced into the Soviet economy. For the first time in 60 years, it was no longer illegal to buy and sell for profit. However, the policy was a failure. There was no overall increase in output. Instead, there were chronic problems of unemployment, growth of black markets, as well as shortages in necessities. The number of unprofitable enterprises that needed government support also increased, while many Soviet citizens lost interest in setting up their businesses.

The failure of the Perestroika reforms put further strain on the already weakened Soviet economy and brought increased hardship to its people. This fostered growing resentment that eventually contributed to the disintegration of the USSR and, thus, the end of the Cold War.
