## US Economic Superiority

### Examples and Explanation

In the 1970s, the United States and Western Europe enjoyed an economic boom. For example, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of the USA grew from US$23,958 to US$29,611 between 1970 and 1980. In contrast, in the same period, the USSRâ€™s GDP per capita only grew from US$8,886 to US$10,245. This boom was partially a result of measures pursued by leaders such as US President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who emphasised that governments should cut taxes and advocated that governments should spend less and limit their involvement in people's lives, such as through welfare or state healthcare, as far as possible.

As a result of this economic boom, the US and its allies could simply outspend the USSR in the superpower competition in a way that the Soviets struggled to overcome. This encouraged the Soviets to seek to de-escalate the tensions underpinning the Cold War, thus contributing to its end.
