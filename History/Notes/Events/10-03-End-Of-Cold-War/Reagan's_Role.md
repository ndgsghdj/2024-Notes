## Reagan's Role

### Examples and Explanation

Ronald Reagan became the President of the United States in 1981 and would remain in office till 1989. Reagan had a straightforward and aggressive approach towards the USSR. Essentially, to him, the USSR was wrong, and the United States and its allies were right. In one speech, he even referred to the USSR as an "evil empire". He thus believed in taking a tough line with the USSR wherever possible and increasing US defence spending. For example, he supported anti-communist forces in Afghanistan and Nicaragua. He also increased the US defence budget massively, as seen by how, in his first two weeks in office, he increased the defence budget by $32.6 billion. This spending helped with the introduction of new weapons systems, such as the B1 nuclear bomber that enhanced US military might and threatened the USSR.

This confrontational attitude towards the USSR, when they were already in a state of decline and increasingly unable to compete on equal terms, encouraged them to attempt to de-escalate the tensions underpinning the Cold War, thus contributing to its end.
