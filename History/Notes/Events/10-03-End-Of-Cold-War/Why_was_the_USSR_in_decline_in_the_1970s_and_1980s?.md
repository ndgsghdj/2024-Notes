## Why was the USSR in decline in the 1970s and 1980s?

### Weaknesses of the Soviet Economy: Structural Weaknesses of the Command Economy

#### Examples and Explanation

The Soviet economy had worked relatively well when it consisted of a small number of very large industries, particularly coal, steel and electricity. The government could make decisions about these industries, which could then be implemented. However, as the Soviet economy grew and expanded by the 1970s, the Soviet economy became overwhelmed by the increasing demands. The Soviet government struggled to cope with the many companies making different goods. It acted too
slowly and made poor decisions. As a result, the USSR began to experience a steady, long-term decline in the rate of growth. For example, output growth for Soviet agriculture dropped from 4.8 percent a year in the 1950s to 1.8 per cent in the 1970s. Similarly, by the late 1970s, industrial output had dropped from a double digit percentage growth to a 3 to 4 percent decline.

The structural weaknesses of the command economy has thus translated into the decline of growth in the Soviet economy as the economy grew beyond the ability of the command economy system to efficiently manage, leading to overall Soviet decline.
