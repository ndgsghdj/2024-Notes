## Gorbachevâ€™s reforms: "De-Ideologisation" of Soviet Foreign Policy

### Examples and Explanation

In 1985, the USSR elected 54-year-old Mikhail Gorbachev to be its leader. Gorbachev was aware of the terrible problems facing the USSR and introduced a series of radical measures to reform it. One area of his reforms was in regard to the "de-Ideologisation" of Soviet Foreign Policy. This meant an end to all ideologically driven engagements designed to promote communism globally and challenge the United States. Gorbachev recognised that to reform the Soviet economy successfully, he had first to reduce the large amounts of money being spent overseas as part of these efforts. To that effect, he declared that the USSR would no longer intervene in other countries to support communist regimes or takeovers, as it did under former leaders such as Brezhnev. To demonstrate his commitment towards de-ideologisation, Gorbachev withdrew troops from military engagements in Afghanistan and Angola alongside Soviet support for communist regimes in Cuba and Vietnam.

By no longer engaging in superpower competition with the United States, the USSR eliminated one of the biggest sources of tension fueling the Cold War, thus contributing to its end.
