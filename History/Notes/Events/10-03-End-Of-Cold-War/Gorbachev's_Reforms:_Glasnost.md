## Gorbachev's Reforms: Glasnost

### Examples and Explanation

In 1985, the USSR elected 54-year-old Mikhail Gorbachev to be its leader. Gorbachev was aware of the terrible problems facing the USSR and introduced a series of radical measures in a bid to reform it. One of these reforms was the policy of Glasnost ("openness"). Under this policy, Gorbachev called for open debate on government policy and honesty in facing up to problems. With openness and reforms, the Soviet people were able to learn about the heinous crimes committed by the Soviet Union in the past. For example, during the Stalinist years in an exhibition called "Week of Conscience" held in November 1988. Unfortunately, Glasnost backfired. It released much resentment against the communist government. Glasnost also exposed the shortcomings of the government officials such as their inefficiency and corruption. This led to decreasing confidence in the party. The Soviets were also further exposed to aspects of the outside world, especially the better quality of life in the United States and Western European countries, through popular Western culture.

### Link

As a result, the positive picture of Soviet life that the government previously presented to the public quickly fell apart. Many in the Soviet bloc felt deceived and lost confidence in the vision and rule of the communist governments. Hence, instead of rallying the people behind the reforms of "openness", Glasnost had unintentionally created a platform which unleashed criticism of communist rule that eventually brought about the disintegration of the USSR and thus the end of the Cold War.
