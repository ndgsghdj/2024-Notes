## Decline of Detente

- In 1977, after the USSR's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, then US President Jimmy Carter in 1977 abandoned detente and took a much more aggressive approach towards the USSR.
- At the same time, Brezhnev began to think the USSR was not gaining much from detente either.
- Both sides began to criticise each other's actions again and accused the other of breaking their promises.
    - Examples
        - Carter blamed the USSR for not settling disputes peacefully.
            - According to Carter, the USSR was making things worse by supplying arms to its allies in war zones such as Angola and Ethiopia.
        - Brezhnev countered that the United States was doing pretty much the same in Central and South America, as well as in South Africa.
        - They also accused each other of trying to get around the various nuclear arms limitation treaties.
        - The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.
            - When Carter heard about the invasion, he described it as "the most serious threat to peace since the Second World War."
