## Gorbachev's Reforms: Reduction on military spending


### Examples and Explanation


In 1985, the USSR elected 54-year-old Mikhail Gorbachev to be its leader. Gorbachev was aware of the terrible problems facing the USSR and introduced a series of radical measures to reform it. One area of his reforms was in regard to military spending. Gorbachev was realistic enough to recognise that the USSR could not hope to outspend the United States on nuclear weapons and other military spending. He thus began to take measures to reduce Soviet military spending. In 1988, he began the final withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Furthermore, in 1990, Gorbachev signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) that established comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment in Europe.

Both these measures allowed the Soviets to reduce military spending, causing the Soviet Unionâ€™s competitors in the Cold War, the US and its Western allies, to feel less threatened by it. This, in turn, reduced tensions and thus contributed to the end of the Cold War.
