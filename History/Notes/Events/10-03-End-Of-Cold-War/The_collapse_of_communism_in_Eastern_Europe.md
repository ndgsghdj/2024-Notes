## The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe

### Examples and Explanation

In July 1988, Gorbachev made a speech at the Warsaw Pact summit stating his intention to withdraw large numbers of Soviet troops, tanks and aircraft from other communist states. In March 1989, Gorbachev made clear to the Warsaw Pact leaders that the Soviet army would leave Eastern Europe and would no longer prop their countries up. In the months that followed, there was a sudden and dramatic collapse of communism across Eastern Europe. For example, in October 1989, Hungary declared itself a democratic republic rather than a communist republic. Furthermore, on 9 November, the guards abandoned the Berlin Wall, and jubilant crowds began to dismantle it.

### Link

As communism collapsed in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union did nothing to stop it, one of the largest points of contention between the two superpowers disappeared. This led to a drastic reduction in tensions that contributed to the end of the Cold War.
