## Gorbachev’s reforms: The Reagan-Gorbachev Summits


### Examples and Explanation


In response to Gorbachev’s reforms and a desire to advance nuclear disarmament and tamp down the strategic arms race, Reagan made overtures to Soviet leaders and eventually engaged Gorbachev in negotiations with a shared commitment to nuclear abolition. This led to five summit meetings between Reagan and Gorbachev from 1985 and 1988. By the end of these summits, they had reached agreements to reduce their nuclear weapons further. Reagan also declared that he no longer thought the USSR was an "evil empire" because of the changes Gorbachev was making.
