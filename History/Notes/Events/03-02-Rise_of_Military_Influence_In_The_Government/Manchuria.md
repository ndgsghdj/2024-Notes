## Manchuria


### Background


- Another discontented group in the military was the Kwantung Army stationed in Manchuria
    * It had been created in 1906 to protect Japan's Manchurian assets.
- Manchuria was seen as a solution to Japan's lack of natural resources as it was rich in natural resources (e.g. iron and coal)
- From 1916, China was divided into regions ruled by various warlords who fought each other for power
    * Initially, Manchuria's warlord, Zhang Zuolin, developed friendly relations with Japan and the Kwantung Army.
    * Over the years, Zhang's inability to defend Japan's interests frustrated the Kwantung Army.
- Assassination of Zhang Zuolin, 1928
    * The Kwantung Army assassinated Zhang to attempt to replace him with a more cooperative leader
    * Planned to:
        + Blame it on his rivals among the other Chinese warlords
        + Create a reason to force the Japanese government to take over Manchuria to better protect Japanese interests.
    * Aftermath
        + The Emperor criticised the Kwantung Army's actions and demanded the PM to discipline them.
        + Without the authority to do so, the PM was unable to force the military to punsih those responsible for the asassination.
        + This revealed:
            + The Emperor's inability to control the military
            + The Military's ability to defy the civilian government.
- Mukden Incident, 1931
    * Background
        + Radical elements of the military especially in the Kwantung Army were emboldened by the assassination of Zhang Zuolin
            + E.g. Ishiwara Kanji
        + Ishiwara:
            + Was convinced that Japan should prepare for an inevitable war with the USA
            + Had plans to turn Manchuria into a colony and settle Japanese farmers there
            + Wanted to rebuilt Japanese society into one where all Japanese worked for each other and the Emperor, not themselves or corporations.
        + Although, they did not say so publicly, many top Japanese military leaders supported Ishiwara's views.
        + In September 1931, the Kwantung Army blew up a section of the railway at Mukden
            + They blamed it on the Chinese government
            + Used it as an excuse to take over Manchuria
        + By December, the Kwantung Army was in control of most of the region
        + In March 1932, the Japanese renamed it Manchukuo
    * Manchukuo
        + Theoretically independent, in practice was a Japanese colony
    * Aftermath
        + Military in Japan supported the Kwantung Army's actions
            + Civilian government could do nothing
        + Showed the limited control of the civilian government over the military and that the military had a greater say in Japanese foreign policy.
        + The invasion of Manchuria proved extremely popular with the Japanese people
            + Many saw Manchuria as a solution to Japan's economic problems
            + The victory was celebrated throughout Japan
            + It brought a unity to the Japanese people who had been divided in recent years due to the economic challenges of the 1920s.
