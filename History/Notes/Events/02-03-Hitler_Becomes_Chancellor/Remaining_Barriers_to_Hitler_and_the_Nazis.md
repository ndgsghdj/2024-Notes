## Remaining Barriers to Hitler and the Nazis


- Between 1929 and 1932, the Nazis’ support and representation in the Reichstag had increased massively
- However, Presdient Hindenburg remained a barrier to Hitler and the Nazis’ ascent to power
    - He was a national hero and well respected by the people because he was the senior commander in WW1
    - He did not really like democracy but served as President (1925-1929) to serve as a force of stability for the sake of the country
        - He was even convinced to stand for elections again in 1932 even though he wanted to retire and **won** it
            - This was a problem for the Nazis because he disliked Hitler, believing he would destabilize Germany.
