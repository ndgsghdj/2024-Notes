## February 26 Incident (1936)


- Young officers in the Imperial Way Faction led a military coup. They attempted to assassinate key government leaders and demanded for a new government.
- This was part of their call for a Showa Restoration, which aimed to restore Japanâ€™s glory by honouring the Emperor, defending the empire and improving the life for ordinary people.
- The coup failed and the Emperor condemned their actions. Nineteen leading figures in the Imperial Way Faction were arrested, tried in a secret military court, and executed.
