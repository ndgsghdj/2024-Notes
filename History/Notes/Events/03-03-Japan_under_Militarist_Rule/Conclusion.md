## Conclusion


- By the mid 1930s, Japan had come under an authoritarian rule with the military completely in control of the government.
    - It had tightened its control over Japan’s politics, economy and society.
    - National pride was championed through military successes and education.
        - This pride would embolden the military to pursue expansionist policies, despite the increasing international pressure from the West. All of these would set the stage for Japan’s role in the outbreak of WWII in the Asia-Pacific.

| 26 February 1936 Coup                | A group of young officers from the revolutionist ‘Imperial Way’ faction of the army unsuccessfully tried to instigate a military coup and assassinate key government leaders. The failure allowed the conservative ‘Control’ faction of the army to seize control of the military and reunify it as a cohesive political force.                         | The military leadership was able to regain control over most of its soldiers and officers, increasing their strength. The new strength of the military leadership over the cabinet allowed them to appoint an active general as the Minister of War, a previously civilian post.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The conservative military leadership now had more direct power in the Cabinet and influence over the remaining government, which enabled them to holistically shape Japan for war. Therefore it impacted Japan politically                                                                                                                                                      |
| Japan’s Industrialisation            | New industrialisation efforts shifted the emphasis from consumer industries to heavy industries that would promote self-sufficiency, while increasing the production of military goods.                                                                                                                                                                   | The military leadership’s strong and generous support for these new productions led to the new emergence of new zaibatsus that were closely allied with the military government. The close cooperation ensured tha the military had key resources and production facilities, as well as capability to better exploit the raw resources of Korea and Manchuria                                                                                                                                                      | This impacted Japan economically as the dominance of pro-militarist zaibatsus meant that Japan’s economy was repurposed for war preparation while under increased state control.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Formation of Cartels                 | To minimise competition between the zaibatsus, the military government implemented the Principal Industries Control Law of 1931 which allowed zaibatsus to form cartels. These cartels limit competition by regulating price and production share across the industry. Soon, the government would play a direct role in influencing these cartels. | The virtual elimination of competition from key heavy industries created an environment that was more conducive for the military government’s goal to coordinate and direct economic activity in Japan. The cartels created a platform for the military government to later control the production activities of wartime industries.                                                                                                                                                                   | With the military’s direct intervention in cartels, the military leadership had gained a virtual monopoly over production and resource extraction across the growing Japanese empire.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Increased Control of Labour Unions   | In 1936, the military government began to oppose labour unions; thousands of workers were forced to withdraw from government employee unions.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Workers in Japan were less able to negotiate or campaign for more favourable working conditions or contracts; the military government now could more easily ‘silence’ the country’s economic manpower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Besides increasing government control over the economy, the opposition towards labour unions led to a repression of individual rights in Japan. Society had less avenues to oppose the imposition of the military government’s values and goals onto them.                                                                                                                      |
| Campaign for Economic Revitalisation | This initiative was a mix of propaganda and practical proposals to improve the crop yield in rural areas while increasing the incomes of farmers                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The initiative was successful in addressing the agricultural issues that hindered Japan’s industrialisation, therefore enabling the military government to better manage resources and production. Moreover, the success of the campaign helped to increase the military government’s popularity with the rural population, especially with the campaign espousing the merit of reviving traditional values. This enabled the government’s values and goals to be more deeply entrenched among the farmers. | The success of the campaign increased the political influence of the military government over the rural countryside in Japan. Furthermore, the improvement of the farmer’s situations helped to improve the social stability and cohesion in rural society.                                                                                                                       |
| Censorship                           | In 1936, the military government formed the Information and Propaganda Committee that censored material which either painted the military or the emperor in a bad light. Furthermore, the military police detained and silenced individuals espousing undesirable political or social views.                                                            | The legal control of information helped the military government maintain a positive public image in the eyes of the public, while making their values and beliefs increasingly persuadable. In short, the military government could now police the circulation of opinions among Japanese individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The censorship of alternative views repressed the Japanese individual’s ability to express contrarian thoughts, while shaping society to become more rigid and dictated by the authoritarian government.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Increased Control of Education       | The Japanese curriculum sought to instil a sense of patriotism, ultranationalism, and militarism in youths. In particular, youths were shaped to disregard individualism for their nation.                                                                                                                                                            | Education proved to be potent in shaping society’s values and beliefs to be increasingly aligned and subservient to the goals of the military government. Moreover, individual youths are nurtured to become more conforming to ideological and military expectations than to develop their own individualism.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Socially, an education system that inducts youths into a militarist system led to a more regimented and ultranationalistic society. Politically, alternative and more moderate political views became less common as the new generation of youths were limited by a militarist mindset. Support for aggressive foreign policy became increasingly unanimous as a result. |
