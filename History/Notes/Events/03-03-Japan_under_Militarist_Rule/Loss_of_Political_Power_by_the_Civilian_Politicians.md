## Loss of Political Power by the Civilian Politicians


- The growing influence of the military caused the civilian politicians’ power to diminish. The Japanese people supported the military officers and their expansionist plans.
- In July 1937, Prince Konoe Fuminaro was appointed as Prime Minister. In the same month that he was appointed, the military led an invasion into China.
- In October 1937, he also permitted the formation of a Cabinet Planning Office made up of mostly military officers. Japan’s finances was now controlled by a military rather than a civilian politician.
- In October 1941, the army minister, General Tojo Hideki, took over the role of the Prime Minister. This signalled the military’s total control over the Japanese government.

# Economic Consolidation

- Under the militarist government, measures were put in place to strengthen the economy and tighten its control.
    - This enabled Japan’s economy to improve, especially after 1932, as evident in the graph.
    - In fact, its economic recovery in the 1930s was far quicker than those of Western powers.
