    - The campaign also praised women in rural Japan for their traditional roles in working on the farm and managing the home.

### Controlling Workplaces

The government began to search for strategies to manage workers and increase productivity. In 1937, the government implemented a network of “discussion councils”in all workplaces. 

- These councils were made up of worker and manager representatives
- They were to cooperate to prevent conflict in the workplaces.
- Workers were told that companies were like families, where every member was equally valuable before the Emperor.

### Eliminating Opposition

- Individuals who promoted ideas that did not conform to the governmentwre also silenced.
    - This included individuals with socialist beliefs, such as political leaders, intellectuals and university students. They were imprisoned or dismissed from their positions.
- These individuals were silenced or imprisoned by a special police force in Japan and the military police or the Kempeitai in the Japanese empire.

### Control of Education

- Even before the militarist government came into power, Japan’s education system already had a strong emphasis on national pride and the importance of Japanese traditions. It also stressed Shinto beliefs, loyalty to the Emperor and the community over the individual.
- In 1937, the Ministry of Education published a document called **Fundamentals of Our National Policy** (Kokutai no Hongi) and used it as a basis for Japan’s education system.
    - This document was distributed to the officials and educators, and was intended to guide teachers in inculcating Japanese traditional ethics in their students.
