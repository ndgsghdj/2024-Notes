## Japan’s Industrialisation

- The militarist government continued to promote Japan’s industrialisation.
- It was encouraged by its new emphasis on expanding the empire and preparing for war.
    - It shifted from developing consumer industries to heavy industries and chemical production
    - This led to the production of weapons and big infrastructure projects like roads, railways and bridges.
- The government also increased spending to stimulate the economy
    - More money was set aside for heavy industries, expanding the manufacturing industries and strengthening Japan’s economy.
- The set-up of these new industries gave rise to new zaibatsu.
    - E.g. Nissan, Nichitsi and Mori
    - They were, at that time, closely linked to and influenced by the military.
    - They played a key role in developing Japan’s empire economically and exploiting the resources in Korea and Manchuria
    - The military hoped that this would enable Japan to develop into a self-sufficient and industrially strong state.

### Control of Industry - Formation of Cartels

- The government also began to exercise control over Japan’s industry, especially the zaibatsu.
    - The government believed that competition between the zaibatsu was wasteful, and feared that they would seek to make profits, sometimes at the expense of the country.
        - For example, they might choose not to build a railway because it was unprofitable, even though it would have improved Japan’s transport network.
    - To manage the zaibatsu, the government passed the **Principal Industries Control Law in 1931.**

### Principal Industries Control Law

**Intended Outcome**

- To form cartels that would control prices and production across the various zaibatsu so as to limit competition and regulate the production and prices of the products they sold.
- The zaibatsu chiefs would manage these cartels.

**Actual Outcome**

- Over time, the government became more directly involved in the cartels and even controlled the cartels.
    - For example, in 1936, the officials and military commanders in the Cabinet brought the electric power industry under direct government control.
- The zaibatsu chiefs were furious at this law but were unable to resist the government.
- In 1937, the government introduced the Five-Year Plans setting targets for production in various industries.

### Control of Labour Unions

- In the 1920s, the government had encouraged the formation of labour unions as it could bring stability to the country.
- However, by 1936, the militarist government had a different attitude towards labour unions.
    - It no longer favoured unions and forced thousands of workers to withdraw from the union of government employees

### Improving Conditions in Japan’s Countryside

- The Great Depression hit Japanese farming and farmers hard. By 1932, many farmers were heavily in debt. They struggled to pay their rent, taxes and feed their families.
- To address this, the government introduced a range of measures to help farmers pay off their debts.
    - For example, the government increased public works in the countryside to provide jobs for people living there.
- In 1932, the Ministry of Agriculture launched the **Campaign for Economic Revitalistation**

### Campaign for Economic Revitalisation

- The campaign was a mix of propaganda and practical proposals aimed to strengthen the countryside.
    - The campaign stressed the need to revive the spirit of cooperation in rural areas
    - It also encouraged farmers to utilise scientific farming methods instead of traditional ones.
    - Farmers received guidance on how to better manage crops and finances on their farms.

**Outcome**

- Many farmers signed up for the campaign.
- Helped farmers to increase their income
- The government presented success stories to motivate more farmers to take part.
- **However,** conditions did not improve significantly because the government was more focused on industrialisation
