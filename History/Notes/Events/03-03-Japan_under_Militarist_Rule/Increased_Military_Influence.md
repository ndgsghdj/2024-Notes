## Increased Military Influence

### By 1934,

- The civilian politicians were too divided by party differences to stop the growing influence of the military.
- At the same time, the Japanese people increasingly supported the military
    - Military successes since the Meiji period, especially in Manchuria, had become a source of pride.
- As a result, these factors emboldened the military to expand their influence and tighten their control over the Japanese government
    - Military officers could now take civil positions originally reserved for non-military politicians
    - Supervision of Manchuria was handed over to the military

### From 1935…

- The military controlled government conducted a campaign of “electoral purification” which it claimed aimed to remove corrupt practices in the government
    - In truth, it was aimed at individuals and groups who held views that the military government found unacceptable (e.g. socialism and communism)
- With the military increasingly in control, the political parties and even elections became less important
    - Few Japanese bothered to vote

### Emergence of Control Faction

While the military was getting strong, it was not united.

- It was divided between the Imperial Way Faction and the Control Faction
- This feud between the two factions was a bitter and a turning point in their relationship was the **February 26 Incident in 1936.**

### The Imperial Faction

- Made up of some military commanders with more radical views, such as Araki Sadao, junior officers and some civilian supporters
- Believed that Japan should put less emphasis on modernising its economy and military, and put more emphasis on the Bushido spirit and developing personal qualities such as honour, loyalty, obedience and patience.
- Wanted Japan to be freed from corrupt government officials and greedy zaibatsu, and to be run directly by Emperor Hirohito

### Control Faction

- Made up of very senior commanders in the army with more moderate views, including the powerful and influential General Tojo Hideki
- Thought that war with the West, especially the United States, was inevitable, and wanted to mobilise and prepare Japan for such a war.
- Believed that the government should collaborate with the heads of the zaibatsu and give them control of key industry sectors or important construction projects
