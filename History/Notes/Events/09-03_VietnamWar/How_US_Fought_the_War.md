## How US Fought the War


### Overall Strategy


- The United States used its superior air power to engage in strategic bombing to disrupt North Vietnamese supply lines.
    * For example, during Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965, North Vietnamese cities, factories and army bases, Viet Cong strongholds in South Vietnam and the Ho Chi Minh Trail were bombed.
        + It resulted in thousands of civilian casualties.

### Support from its Civilian Population


- The United States lacked the same level of popular support as North Vietnam did.
- The frequent "Search and Destroy" missions to hunt down the Viet Cong forces often resulted in many civilian deaths. The use of defoliants such as __Agent Orange__ and __napalm__ as weapons also resulted in long-term health problems for civilians
    * This led to low support for the United States.

### Morale


- Although morale among the US troops was high at the beginning of the war, it fell as the war intensified.
- Following the introduction of conscription, many US troops sent to Vietnam over the course of the war were young and inexperienced.
    * They did not understand why they were conscripted to fight a war in a faraway country, for a people they knew nothing about.
- The low morale was worsened by the media's portrayal of the US involvement in the war as an unjust one.
