## Local Agent: South Vietnam

- South Vietnam responded with a policy called the Strategic Hamlet programme where peasants were relocated (sometimes by force) to fortified villages away from the control and influence of the Viet Cong.
    * The Strategic Hamlets also supported Diem's vision of transforming the countryside to create a national identity and localised democracy.
    * Removing civilians also allowed the superior firepower of the US Air Force and South Vietnamese Army to destroy the Viet Cong without civilians being caught in the crossfire.
