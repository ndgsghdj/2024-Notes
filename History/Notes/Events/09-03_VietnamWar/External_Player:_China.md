## External Player: China

- After the communist victory in China in 1949, Mao saw the United States as his greatest threat.
    * He was especially concerned about a possible invasion by US allies, backed by US forces.
    * Mao believed that if Vietnam became a non-communist country that was allied with the United States, China was potentially vulnerable to attack from South Korea, Vietnam and the GMD government in Taiwan.
    * Thus, he was eager to support any state or group that created an anti-US buffer in Vietnam, especially if it was a communist one.
- Another reason why Mao wanted to help North Vietnam was to show support for another communist state. In addition, he felt a bond of loyalty to Ho.
- It is also probable that Mao believed involvement in the Vietnam War could help unite the Chinese people under his leadership.
    * He had done the same in the Korean War and it had strengthened his position, particularly when Chinese forces pushed US troops back in Korea.
