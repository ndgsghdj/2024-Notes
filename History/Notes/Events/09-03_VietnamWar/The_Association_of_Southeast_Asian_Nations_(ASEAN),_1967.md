## The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), 1967

- The inability of the United States to win the Vietnam War and contain communism in Vietnam stoked fears of the spread of communism in Southeast Asia.
    * This fear contributed to the formation of __the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)__ in 1967.
- ASEAN also declared Southeast Asia as a Zone of Peace, Friendship, and Neutrality in 1971.
    * This was aimed towards keeping ASEAN free from the interference of any outside powers.
