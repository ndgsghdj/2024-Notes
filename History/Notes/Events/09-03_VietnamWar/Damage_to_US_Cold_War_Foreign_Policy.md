| A bankrupt ideology            | The campaign against communism was portrayed by the United States as a moral crusade. However, </br> - The Vietnam War had demonstrated that the ideology of the West was not morally superior. </br> - The atrocities committed by US soldiers and the use of chemical weapons had damaged its reputation                                                                                                |
| Failure of containment         | The United States had failed to enact containment in Southeast Asia despite its military strength. </br> - As feared by the proponents of the domino theory, after the fall of South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia also turned communist by 1975.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Weakening of the US Presidency | The United States Congress had traditionally supported the Presidents in their conduct of foreign policy. However, towards the end of the Vietnam War, Congress exercised greater oversight of presidential actions. </br> - For example, Congress forbade US military aid to Cambodia in 1970. In 1973, it introduced the War Powers Act, limiting the ability of the President to go to war. |
