## South Vietnam in the 1950s


### Early Stages of Ngo Din Diem's Regime


- By the end of the Geneva Conference, Ngo Dinh Diem was the Prime Minister of South Vietnam
- While a fervent anti-communist, Diem was also a patriot who hoped to modernise Vietnamese economy and society to strengthen the country against interference by foreign powers.
- Early in his presidency, Diem implemented some modernisation programmes.
- Examples:
    * Construction of universities and the expansion of agriculture. 
    * Attempts to transform the countryside with the aims of creating a national identity and localised democracy.
- Despite these attempts, Diem's regime proved to be increasing unpopular as the 1950s progressed due to the use of authoritarian methods. The regime frequently imprisoned and sometimes executed opponents.

### A Rigged Referendum


- In July 1955, Diem announced that the Vietnam-wide elections agreed at the Geneva Conference would not be held.
- In October, he held a referendum on a proposal to remove Head of State Bao Dai, the last Emperor of Vietnam, and install himself as President.
    * The results showed that 98% of voters approved the proposal
    * But the referendum was rigged.
        + In some areas, the votes approving of Diem outnumbered the registered voters.
    * Diem's actions had the support and involvement of the United States
        + South Vietnam depended heavily on US financial and military support
        + This thus allowed it to be deeply involved in the political affairs of South Vietnam
        + The United States supported Diem because he was strongly anti-communist.

### Diem's Unpopular and Corrupted Regime


#### Nepotism


- Diem blatantly practised __nepotism__
    * Nepotism - the practice of those in power of favoring relatives e.g. giving them jobs or other preferential treatment, often without merit.
- He appointed his brothers as key officials and diplomats.

Diem also __refused to hold elections__, even for local councils.

#### Protests


- There were widespread protests against his regime.
- They were often led by well-organised, well-educated and influential Buddhist monks, whom the regime showed little respect for.
    * Some Buddhist monks protested by setting themselves on fire - an act known as self-immolation
        + The graphic images of these acts of self-immolation made Diem even more unpopular among the people.

#### American Frustrations


- The United States was concerned and frustrated by Diem's actions but could not find anyone better.
- In the 1950s, the United States supported his regime with around $1.6 billion.
- Despite the US support, the regime was weak and unable to prevent a communist insurgency in the countryside.
