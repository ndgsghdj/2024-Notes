## How North Vietnam Fought the War

### Overall Strategy

- Due to an inferiority in military equipment, the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese turned to __guerilla warfare__ in order to avoid large-scale battles that were not in their favour.
    * They did not wear uniforms and were hard to tell apart from the peasants.
    * They attacked and then disappeared into the jungles, villages or tunnels, e.g. __Cu Chi tunnels__

### Support from its Civilian Population

- North Vietnam knew how important it was to win over the population.
- The Viet Cong were expected to respect and help the peasants.
- That said, they were prepared to kill those who opposed them or cooperated with their enemies.
    * Between 1966 and 1971, the Viet Cong killed an estimated 27,000 civilians.

### Morale

- One million Viet Cong and North Vietnamese are estimated to have died in the war, far exceeding US losses.
    * This loss was a price that Ho was prepared to pay as the war was seen as a war of national liberation.
- The greatest strength of the Viet Cong was the refusal to give into anything less than the complete removal of the United States from Vietnam.
