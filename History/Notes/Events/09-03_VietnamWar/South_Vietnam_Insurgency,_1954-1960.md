## South Vietnam Insurgency, 1954-1960

### Beginnings

- Besides the Buddhist monks, various groups opposed Diem's regime throughout the 1950s.
    * Most of them were former members of the Viet Minh who believed in unification of North and South Vietnam.
- After Diem's cancellation of the promised 1956 reunification elections, many former Viet Minh members started to wage a low-level campaign of disruption and harrassment against his regime.

### Diem's Response to the Insurgency

- Thousands of suspected communists were locked up, with many tortured and executed. 
- He also tried to strike at the insurgents military bases and had some success between 1954 and 1957.
- However, this did not stem the insurgency.

### Support from South Vietnam

- In __May 1959,__ the North Vietnam Communist party approved the setting up of Group 559, a specialised unit of the North Vietnam Army.
    * Its job was to transport weapons, ammunition and other equipment to the insurgents.

### The Viet Cong

- By 1960, the insurgents had formally organised themselves into the Viet Cong.
- Also known as the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam, the Viet Cong included South Vietnamese opponents of the government.
- Like the preceding Viet Minh, it comprised large numbers of communist North Vietnamese taking orders from Ho.
- Between 1957 and 1960, they carried out around 1,700 assassinations.
    * These attacks could be on anyone associated with the South Vietnamese government, including police officers, officers of the law courts and administrators.
    * The insurgents also assassinated anyone suspected of collaborating with the government.
- In addition, they staged hundreds of attacks on government forces.
- The group later created a supply route, known as the __Ho Chi Minh Trail__. It would become a central resource in the conflict which was about to escalate.

By the early 1960s, the insurgency showed no signs of being suppressed and was in fact growing in intensity.
- This threatened Diem's regime
- It contributed to the conflict escalating into a full blown conflict/the Vietnam War.
