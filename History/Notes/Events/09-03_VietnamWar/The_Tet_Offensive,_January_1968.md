## The Tet Offensive, January 1968


- From 1965 to 1967, the official view in the United States was that the war was going reasonably well.
    * As the fight against the Viet Cong insurgency had no clear territorial goals to capture, the US and South Vietnamese forces used "body count" as a means of measuring success.
        + The goal was to kill as many Viet Cong soldiers as possible so as to wear the enemy down.
- This confidence was shattered by the Tet Offensive in January 1968
- During the Vietnamese New Year (Tet) holiday, Viet Cong fighters attacked over 100 cities and other military targets
- Leading up to the attack, the Viet Cong used the Ho Chi Minh Trail to move war material and fighters from North Vietnam to the South
- The Tet Offensive involved around 80,000 Viet Cong and North Vietnam Army troops.
- There was particularly bitter fighting over the city of Hue and around the US military base at Khe Sanh in the northern part of South Vietnam.
    * __Note: This is different from the battle from the 1st Indochina War previously discussed. That took place in Hanoi.__
- The Offensive was costly for the communists, with the Viet Cong being badly weakened, having lost around 10,000 experienced fighters.
- Furthermore, the people of South Vietnam did not rise up and join the Viet Cong as hoped.

### Aftermath of the Tet Offensive - Shifting Sentiments in the US


- Despite its failure to achieve military objectives, the Tet Offensive proved to be a turning point in the war as it raised hard questions in the United States
    * The United States had nearly 500,000 troops in Vietnam and was spending $520 billion a year on the war. So why had the communists been able to launch a major offensive that took US forces completely by surprise?
    * The US and South Vietnamese forces quickly retook the towns captured in the offensive. However, in order to do so, they required large amounts of artillery and air power. Many civilians were killed and the ancient city of Hue was destroyed. Considering these casualties was the war really justified?

#### Role of Media


- Widely and graphically covered in the media, the Vietnam War is often called the "first television war".
- At first, the relationship between the US government and the media was relatively good as the government wanted to win domestic support for the Vietnam War.
    * For example, journalists accredited by MACV (Military Assistance Command Vietnam) would get access to war zones, interviews and regular reports. In return, they were expected to not reveal any information which would help the enemy
- <ins>However, the Tet Offensive changed the way the war in Vietnam was reported to the American public</ins>
    * During the Tet Offensive, the journalists abandoned their restraint.
    * The Tet Offensive convinced many journalists that the United States could not win the war.
        + For example, Walter Cronkite of CBS News, an American television station, was one such journalist
            + He publicly criticised the US war effort in Vietnam on national television.
            + Though hotly debated, some believed that this swung public opinion on the US involvement in the Vietnam War.

#### Rising Anti-War Sentiments


- Additional media coverage and revelations of US atrocities in the Vietnam War.
    * For example, the My Lai Massacre
        + US soldiers murdered between 347 and 504 unarmed South Vietnamese civilians, shocked the American public.
    * Many people began to demonstrate and protest the US involvement in the Vietnam War.
- The anti-war sentiments were fuelled by graphic images that were publicised in the mainstream media.
    * An example of this was the iconic image of a Viet Cong captain being held at gunpoint and later executed by a South Vietnamese general.
        + This photograph - named "Saigon Execution" - turned the American public against the war effort, with some calling it "the picture that lost the war".

#### The US Looks to Withdraw


- In January 1973, all parties signed the Paris Peace Accords to "end the war and restore peace to Vietnam".
    * With the Paris Peace Accords ending direct US military intervention in Vietnam, Nixon described it as "peace with honour"
- Nixon had promised continuing financial aid and military support to Vietnam, but the US Congress refused to allow it.
    * Nixon himself was in big political trouble over the Watergate scandal.
        + In 1972, he authorised an illegal break-in at the Watergate Complex to place listening devices in the offices of politicians who opposed him.
            + As a result, he was impeached in 1973.
- These political developments made it difficult for Nixon to gain the support of the Congress when it comes to the Vietnam War.
    * Congress also believed that the United States should not continue its involvement in the war, especially given the corruption of the South Vietnamese regime.

#### The US Withdraws


- By 29 March 1973, the last US forces had left Vietnam.
    * Ho had died in 1969 - he did not get to see the US forces leave and his country reunified a few years later.
- Even with the withdrawal of US forces, the new US President, Gerald Ford, wanted to continue providing financial aid to South Vietnam.
    * The request was made in January 1975, and was rejected by Congress,m signaling the lack of support for the Vietnam War.

### The Fall of Saigon, April 1975


- Without US air power or military back-up and without the support of the population, the South Vietnamese government could not survive for long.

#### The Communist Advance


- In December 1974, the North Vietnamese launched a major military offensive against South Vietnam.
- In April 1975, amid the chaos, South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu resigned and fled the capital city, Saigon.
- Saigon fell to the rapidly advancing communist forces and the remaining South Vietnamese government had no choice but to surrender to the North Vietnamese forces.

#### Last Ditch Effort to Flee


- One of the bleakest symbols of Us failure in Vietnam was the televised news images of desperate Vietnamese men, women and children trying to clamber abord helicopters taking off from the US embassy in Saigon.
- This was part of Operation Frequent Wind - the final evacuation of US civilians and Vietnamese from 29 to 30 April 1975, as communist forces swarmed through Saigon
