## Vietnam during WW2


- After WWII broke out in Europe in 1939, France was defeated by Germany a year later in 1940.
- Japan, which was an ally of Germany, wanted access to French Indochina for its resources and strategic position.
    - As a result, Japanese forces invaded the northern region of French Indochina in September 1940 before coming to an armistice and agreement with the French Indochina colonial government.
- The French colonial government was aligned with Vichy France.
    - Vichy France was the new government set up after the defeat of France in 1940, and was aligned to Nazi Germany.
    - Vichy France allowed the Japanese to station troops in Indochina.
    - The French colonial government was often reduced to a puppet of the Japanese during this period.
- French colonial rule and the subsequent Japanese rule in French Indochina were both harsh.
- As a result, various groups emerged to resist French and Japanese rule.
- The most important of these resistance groups was the Viet Minh, led by Ho Chi Minh.
    - The Viet Minh, short for the League for the Independence of Vietnam (Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh), was a nationalist movement that aimed to achieve independence.
    - It was an umbrella movement made up of two main groups:
        - Non-communists who simply wanted to drive the Japanese out of Vietnam in favour of self-rule
        - Communists who wanted to establish an independent communist state in Vietnam.
- During WWII, the Viet Minh received money, weapons and supplies from the United States, the USSR and the Guomindang (GMD) government in China.
    - Even though the GMD government in China was anti-communist, they supported the Viet Minh against the common enemy that was Japan.
