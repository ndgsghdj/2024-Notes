## External Player: The USA

- The United States was convinced that China and the USSR was planning to spread communism to countries in Asia.
    * Due to __domino theory__, it believed that if Vietnam fell under the control of China and the USSR, other countries would also fall under Communism like a row of dominoes.
The United States was so determined to resist communism that it would support anti-communist governments, including Diem's.
    * It did pretty much the same thing in many states in Central and South America.
        + This foreign policy pursued by the United States to prevent the spread of communism abroad was known as __containment.__
- In 1961, __John F. Kennedy__ took over from Eisenhower as US President
    * At this time, the possibility of a communist victory in Vietnam remained.
        + If that happened, it could result in a Southeast Asia being lost to the communists, as suggested by the __domino theory__
    * Kennedy was cautious as he did not want the United States to, in his own words, "blunder into war, unclear about aims or how to get out again"
- Under Kennedy:
    * Military advisors were sent to train the South Vietnamese Army, and military equipment continued to be supplied.
        + These support efforts of the United States were organised under the Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV)
- In 1963, Kennedy was assassinated.
- His successor, __Lyndon B. Johnson__, faced the same challenge: to avoid a full US military commitment to Vietnam while pursuing a containment policy to prevent the communists from coming into power.
- However, Johnson was more convinced and prepared than Kennedy to commit the United States to a full-scale conflict in Vietnam to contain communism
- Under Johnson:
    * Diem was assassinated by South Vietnamese military commanders in 1963
        + This heightened political instability combined with the lack of a strong leader as replacement, to make the situation seem to favour a communist takeover.
    * Tensions between the United States and the communist bloc increased due to various international developments such as:
        + China exploding its first atomic bomb in October 1964
        + The USSR showing little interest in peaceful co-existence with the West
    * Committed to preserving the independence of South Vietnam as an anti-communist state, the United States increased the number of military advisors and economic assistance.
