## The Geneva Conference, 1954

- After the defeat of Dien Bien Phu, the French government and public lost interest in retaining Vietnam as a colony as the cost of the conflict outweighed the benefits.

### The Geneva Conference

- An international conference, attended by France, the Viet Minh, the USSR, China, the United States, and Britain, was held in Geneva, Switzerland.
- The Viet Minh demanded the recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the removal of French troops.
- After weeks of talks, Vietnam was divided into two along the 17th parallel:
    * A communist-dominated North Vietnam under Ho;
    * And a non-communist South Vietnam under Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem
- Part of the agreement was that elections would be held by 1956 to establish a single government for a unified Vietnam.
- The agreements brought peace but not stability.
    * With the peace agreement and withdrawal of the French by 1956, the Viet Minh was disbanded.
    * Neither side was happy for the partition, but the only realistic alternative was further fighting.
    * This unhappiness lead to tensions between North Vietnam and South Vietnam that would contribute to the eventual outbreak of the Vietnam War.
