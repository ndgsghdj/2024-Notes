## The First Indochina War

- When WWII ended in 1945, the French and the Allied forces moved to re-occupy Vietnam and accept the surrender of Japanese soldiers in Vietnam.
- The French came back wanting to rule Vietnam again, but quickly faced serious resistance.
    * To the Viet Minh, they had not fought the Japanese only to hand power back to the French.
    * They were determined to take control of the whole country.
    * In response, the Viet Minh entered the city of Hanoi on 2 September 1945 and declared Vietnamese independence.
- Over the course of 1946, tensions between the French and the Viet Minh intensified.
- __The First Indochina War broke out on 16 December 1946.__
- The Viet Minh used the same underground warfare tactics they had used against the Japanese during WWII.
    * They retreated to the mountains and forests and carried out surprise raids against the French.
- At the same time, shifting international relations and increased tensions influenced the way the First Indochina War played out.
- __Chinese Influence__
    * Initially, the anti-communist GMD government in China did not want a pro-communist Viet Minh to take power.
    * However, after the defeat of the GMD at the hands of the Chinese communists, China continued to support the Viet Minh.

### China

- Communist China started to support the Viet Minh by:
    * Supplying food, medical supplies and Soviet-made weapons.
    * Mao also supported Ho's forces with military advisors and training.

### Stalemate and French Defeat

- In response to the growing strength of the Viet Minh, the French launched a propaganda campaign warning people that the Viet Minh was simply the agent of communist China and the USSR.
- The First Indochina War began to escalate, and larger battles were fought.
- __By 1951, the French and Viet Minh forces were at a stalemate.__
- Two separate Vietnamese states emerged by 1954.
    * A communist North
    * A French-backed South

### American Influence

- After WWII, it had to make the choice between supporting the colonial ambitions of France, and supporting the largely communist Viet Minh.
- Hoping to win the sympathies of anti-colonial United States, Ho cleverly kept quiet about wanting a communist Vietnam, and instead portrayed it as a struggle against French colonial rule.
- However, the possibility of winning US support vanished when the communists took power in China.
    * Against the backdrop of the Cold War, the United States believed that Ho and the Viet Minh were controlled by the USSR.
- Therefore, it withdrew its support for the Viet Minh and supported the French, providing weapons and supplies in their fight against the Viet Minh.
- From the United States' point of view, communist China supporting the Viet Minh was a disaster and the start of a communist plan to dominate all of Southeast Asia, a belief known as the __domino theory__.
    * Domino Theory - The belief that if one country fell to communism, the others would fall too, just like a row of dominoes.
- To prevent this, the United States began to pour $500 million a year into the French war effort.
- Meanwhile, the French set up a non-communist government in the south of Vietnam, headed by former Emperor Bao Dai to win local support.

### French Defeat

- As the war dragged on to the early 1950s, the French attempted to lure the Viet Minh out into open battle against strongly defended bases where French superiority in firepower could be used.
    * One such French base was __Dien Bien Phu__
- __13 March - 7 May 1954: Battle of Dien Bien Phu__
    * In 1954, a large well-armed force of French troops was thoroughly defeated by the Viet Minh.
    * The Viet Minh was able to cut off the French army's supply lines, depriving them of food, medical supplies and ammunition.
    * French defeat by the Viet Minh leading to the overall French defeat in the war.
