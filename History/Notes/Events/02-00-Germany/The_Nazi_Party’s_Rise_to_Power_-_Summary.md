| Weaknesses of the Weimar Republic | - Weak constitution of the Weimar Republic. Unpopularity of the Weimar Republic with the German people. | This led to the Nazi Party’s rise to power because… the Weimar Republic was formed based on the Weimar Constitution, subjecting the government to the weaknesses of the constitution. The people were unhappy with the government for accepting the Treaty of Versailles which they thought punished Germany unfairly. It became an unpopular government faced with opposition from both the left and right wing. | This drove people to support the Nazis who seemed to be a strong political party and were strongly opposed to the Treaty of Versailles. |
| Economic Challenges in Germany    | The Great Depression. High unemployment rate in the early 1930s. | This led to the Nazi Party’s rise to power because… the Great Depression led to economic collapse in Germany and unemployment skyrocketed. The economic crisis hit the middle-class the hardest and many workers felt that the crisis had not been well-managed by the government. This caused them to turn away from democracy and look towards other forms of government. | This provided a favourable climate for Hitler’s Nazi Party to rise to power. |
| Appeal of Hitler and the Nazi Party | - Fear of Communism. Hitler’s charisma and oratorical skills. The SA and the SS. Success of Nazi political campaigns | This led to the Nazi Party’s rise to power because… business leaders and farmers looked to the Nazi Party to oppose the Communists. In addition, Hitler was a powerful speaker and the Nazis seemed to be the answer to various problems faced by the German people. Nazi political campaigns were also clever and effective in winning the support of the Germans, with heavy use of propaganda | All these led to a surge in support for the Nazis, allowing them to rise to power. |
