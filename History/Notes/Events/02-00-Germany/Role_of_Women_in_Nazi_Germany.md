## Role of Women in Nazi Germany

### In the Weimar Republic, women…

- Had the right to vote
- Equal in areas of marriage and civic matters

### Hitler’s Beliefs of Women’s Roles

Hitler believed a woman’s role is:

- To be a good mother
- To look after children
- To marry young
- To stay at home while the husband works
- To produce as many babies as possible

To force women to adhere to this belief, the Nazi regime…

- Introduced policies that excluded women from politics and academics
    - Women were not allowed to vote
    - They were discouraged from pursuing university studies.
- Funneled girls into the **League of German Girls (Bund Deutscher Madel/BDM)** where they received vigorous training in domestic tasks
- Introduced policies that limited employment opportunities for women
    - E.g. discrimination against women applicants for jobs was encouraged
- Pushed his beliefs via mass media - posters, radio broadcasts, news <nitb>
- In order to boost population, incentives were given <nitb>:
    - 1933 - Law for the Encouragement of Marriage (provided 1000 marks loan for newly married couples)
    - August 12th - Motherhood Cross

### Reaction of German Women

Most women actually agreed with Hitler’s views even though it meant that women’s rights were restricted. E.g.

- Women employed as teachers, lawyers, doctors and civil servants were sacked
- Married women coudl not wear make-up / trousers
- No dyeing of hair color / perms
- Wear flat shoes
- No slimming/dieting - bad for child birth
- No smoking - un-German behaviour

### Impact

- Boost in birth rate and pregnancies outside marriage
- During WW2…
    - Roles of women had to change, despite Nazi reluctance
    - Female workers employed in arms industries because the supply of unemployed men needed for factory work had dried up
    - However, stereotype of women’s role was mostly maintained e.g. no German women allowed in the armed forces
