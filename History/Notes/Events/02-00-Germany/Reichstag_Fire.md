## Reichstag Fire


On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was burnt down.

- This was in the middle of the campaigning for the 1933 elections
    - Many Germans thought the Nazis were responsible
        - The fire was almost certainly started by the Nazis but the Germans did not know this then
- Hitler claimed that it was started by a lone and mentally unwell communist, Marinus van der Lubbe
    - Hitler declared that it was the start of a communist uprising
    - He thus persuaded Hindenburg to pass an emergency law, the Decree for the Protection of People and State

### The Decree for the Protection of People and State


- Gave Hitler sweeping powers
- Removed freedoms promised by the Weimar Republic
    - Right to a free trial
    - Free press
- The police, SA and SS arrested 4k communists on the night of the fire alone.
- Opposition party meetings, newspapers and radio broadcasts banned.
    - This made it difficult for the opposition to campaign in the 1933 elections
- As a result, the Nazis gained 288 seats
    - With the support of a further 52 DNVP (Deutschnationale Volkspartei / German National Peopleâ€™s Party) delegates, they had a majority (52%) in the Reichstag
