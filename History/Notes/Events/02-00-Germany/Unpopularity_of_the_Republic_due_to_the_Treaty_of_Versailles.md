## Unpopularity of the Republic due to the Treaty of Versailles


Majority of Germans believed the Germany army ended WW1 undefeated. 

- They were not told if the war continued that Germany would be invaded.

They thus expected a negotiated treaty where they were treated as equals/fairly

- They thus saw the Treaty of Versailles as a diktat
- Ebert (the German Chancellor at that time) was reluctant to sign the treaty but had no choice but to do so.

In the minds of many Germans

- Ebert and the other politicians were to blame for the Treaty
    - They were branded the “November Criminals”
- Believed in the *Dolchstoss/*”stabbed in the back” theory and also blamed socialist and liberal politicians for the Treaty.

**Why was this the biggest weaknesses of the Weimar Republic**

It meant that whatever government that came to power in the Weimar Republic would struggle to gain support from the German people.
