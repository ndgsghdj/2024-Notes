## Hitlerâ€™s Rise to Chancellor

In June 1932, Hindenburg appoints Franz von Papen as chancellor

- Hindenburg had wanted a chancellor who had the support of the Reichstag
    - Allow him to take measures without having to call elections and deal with disputes

In July 1932, Hindenburg calls elections hoping von Papen would get enough support in the new Reichstag to create a functioning government

- The plan failed
    - The nazis became the single largest party in the Reichstag with 230 seats (but still not a majority)
        - Hitler demanded to be chancellor
    - von Papen was still able to form a government

In November 1932, Hindenburg called another election

- The Nazis remained the largest party in the Reichstag, but their vote share fell by >2 million and they lost 38 seats

In December 1932, Hindenburg appointed Kurt von Schleicher as Chancellor

- He was a former army general and an old army friend of Hindenburg
- He tried and failed to get Nazi support and was forced to resign.

Throughout 1933, a desperate Hindenburg and von Papen met with industrialists, army leaders and politicians in a bid to create a new functional government

Ultimately, on 30 January 1933, they offered Hitler the post of Chancellor

- von Papen was to be vice-chancellor and there would only be a few other Nazis in senior positions in the new Cabinet
- Despite these limits, public opinion was mixed on the appointment
- They were confident they could control Hitler
    - They believed they could work with Nazi opponents to curb his influence and, if need be, unseat him.
    - They were more concerned with the support of Nazis to restore stability and creating a functional government.
