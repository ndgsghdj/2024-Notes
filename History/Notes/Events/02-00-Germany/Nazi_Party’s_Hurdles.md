## Nazi Partyâ€™s Hurdles

- Nazis were less successful in winning support in the towns
    - Most industrial workers supported the SPD or the communists

The Weimar Republic was stable between 1924 - 1929

- Loans and investments from the US had helped stabilize the economy
    - Plenty of jobs
- Government provided generous welfare benefits e.g. old age pensions and housing

In 1928, despite their hard work, the Nazi Party was still a small minority party

- It had support from <3% of the population
- It also did not have much electoral success i.e. gaining seats in the Reichstag
