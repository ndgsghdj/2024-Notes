## Hitler and the Jews


Hitler hated the Jews

- In his years of poverty in Vienna before WW1, he obsessed over the fact that Jews ran many of the most successful businesses
- He blamed Jewish businessmen and bankers for Germany’s defeat in WW1
    - He believed they forced the German surrender

Once in power, the Nazis began a campaign of anti-semitic persecution

- Many forced out of their jobs
    - They were banned from civil service and a variety of public services (e.g. teaching, broadcasting)
    - As the government took control of the legal and journalistic professions and universities, where many Jews worked, they lost their jobs
- Many Jews also owned small businesses
    - Lost contracts
    - Businesses closed due to intimidation
- Nazi propaganda bombarded Germans with anti-Jewish messages
- Segregation was encouraged
    - In schools, Jewish children were segregated and humiliated
    - Many shops hung “Jews Not Welcome” signs
- SS and SA targeted Jews
    - Jews were arrested and beaten up
    - Jewish shops had slogans painted over their windows (e.g. marked with the Star of David)
    - People were discouraged from buying their goods
- Many left Germany but most stayed
    - They had nowhere else to go

**The Nuremberg Laws**

- Passed in 1935
- Jews were stripped of their German citizenship
- Forbidden to marry pure-blooded Germans

**Kristallnacht/ the Night of Broken Glass**

- In November 1938, a young Jew killed a German diplomat in Paris
- In response, the Nazis proceeded to launch Kristallnacht
    - Plain-clothed SS are given the addresses of Jewish businesses
        - They smashed them up
    - 91 Jews murdered
    - 100s of synagogues burned
    - 20,000 Jews were taken to concentration camps
    - 1000s more left Germany
- Nazi-controlled media painted it as a spontaneous reaction of ordinary Germans against Jews
    - Most Germans did not believe this
- Many Germans were alarmed and concerned
    - But hardly anyone protested
    - The few who did were brutally murdered

**The Final Solution**

- Germany was very successful in the early stages of WW2
    - They captured large areas of Eastern Europe
    - Many Jews lived in these areas
- From 1941 onwards, Jews were subjected to the Final Solution to the Jewish Question
    - Used as slave labour
    - Forced to live in ghettos
    - Systematically killed in death camps
    - **~6 million Jews killed by 1945**
- Historians generally agree that Hitler and SS were responsible for the death camps, though others were responsible too
    - E.g.
        - The genocide would not have been possible without cooperation of the German civil service and police in Germany and occupied lands
        - Others (the German army, major industry leaders and managers) either cooperated with or did nothing to stop the genocide
        - Many historians also believe the German people as a whole also holds some responsibility
