## Living Standards in Nazi Germany


- Big businesses benefitted
    - No longer had to worry about trade unions and strikes
    - Companies like Siemens, Mercedes and Volkswagen made massive profits due to government contracts
    - As a result, managers’ income rose
        - This rise was much faster than the average worker
- Farmers remained poor
    - During the Great Depression, many farmers took loans from banks to survive
    - The Nazis introduced the **Reich Entailed Farm Law** which prevented banks from taking the lands of indebted farmers
    - However, this just meant that the state took on the debt and ownership of the land
- Middle classes saw a mixed picture
    - Many were pleased at the crushing of the communists
    - Owners of businesses connected to rearmament benefitted from government contracts
    - Owners of small businesses continued to struggle
    - **Impact**
        - Whether one’s living standards improved or declined under Nazi rule depended on which class you belonged to.
