## Weimar Constitution

- The new Weimar Republic needed a new constitution (i.e. the highest law of the land) and it was approved by a majority of the Reichstag (the German parliament) in July 1919
- It introduced significant changes:
    - All Germans over the age of 20 could vote, including for the first time, women
    - Party representation would be determined by proportional representation
    - Article 48
- The political structure of the Weimar Government
    
### Proportional Representation

Thanks to the Weimar Constitution, the Weimar Republic operated under a system known as proportional representation where people voted for a party rather than specific candidates and parties gained seats based on the number of votes won.

The Weimar Constitution required that all laws be approved by the Reichstag

**Why was this the biggest weaknesses of the Weimar Republic?**

Proportional representation made it hard for any political party to get a majority during elections. Hence coalition governments were formed.

- **For example,** Friedrichâ€™ Ebertâ€™s Social Democratic Party won the most votes and gained the most seats in the Reichstag following the January 1919 elections and he became President. However, he did not have enough seats to form a government on his own and had to form a coalition with the Catholic Centre Party and the German Democratic Party

As laws needed to be approved by the Reichstag as well, governments had to balance the interests of the various parties that made up its coalitions or risk the collapse of their governments. This made the passing of laws challenging and governments weak and often short-lived.

### Article 48

Allowed the country to be directly ruled by the President without needing to consult the Reichstag during times of crisis.

**Why was this the biggest weaknesses of the Weimar Republic?**

In the hands of a President dedicated to the preservation of democracy, Article 48 could be viewed as a powerful tool in protecting democracy. However, under a president with a different view towards democracy, it could be misused and exploited to bring it down instead, as was the case in the 1930s.

ðŸ’¡ As the Weimar Constitution had weaknesses such as proportional representation and Article 48 that undermined the ability of the Weimar Republicâ€™s governments to operate well and how ultimately Article 48 played a key role in the Republicâ€™s collapse, it is the biggest weakness of the Weimar collapse
