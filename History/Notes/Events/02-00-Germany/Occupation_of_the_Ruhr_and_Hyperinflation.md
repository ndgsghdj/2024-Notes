## Occupation of the Ruhr and Hyperinflation

### The Occupation of the Ruhr

- In January 1923, Germany failed to make one of its reparation payments
- In response, France and Belgium occupied the Ruhr (Germany’s most important and valuable industrial region) and forcibly took what was owed to them in the form of raw materials and goods
- The German government continued to print banknotes, causing them to become worthless as hyperinflation set in
- Prices of daily needs rose rapidly
    - E.g. The price of a loaf of bread in 1923 could have bought a house in 1921
- Personal savings were wiped out
- Unemployment was widespread

### Hyperinflation

- It affected the middle-class most harshly
- Gave the Weimar Republic’s opponents another problem to blame on it
    - Many tied it to the Treaty of Versailles
        - Enhanced resentment towards “November Criminals”

### Resolution

- Gustav Stresemann (new Chancellor) negotiated the reorganisation of reparations (Dawes Plan, 1924 and Young Plan, 1929)
- In November 1925, he replaced the German mark with the Rentenmark
- These measures reduced German debt and ended hyperinflation

### Why was this the biggest weakness of the Weimar Republic

- It undermined support for the Weimar Republic among the German middle-class
- The hardships it brought about made the Germans lose confidence in the Weimar Republic’s ability to cope with future economic crises

# Appeal of Hitler and the Nazi Party

# Background

Whilst the Weimar Republic was struggling to run Germany, a right-wing movement was slowly building in Bavaria (in South Germany)

One of the key groups was the **German Workers’ Party** *(Deutsche Arbeiterpartei/DAP)* founded by Anton Drexler in January 1919.

Adolf Hitler (then an army intelligence officer aka a spy) was sent to investigate the DAP.

- He found he agreed with their ideas
- In September 1919, he joined the DAP

Hitler was an excellent speaker and began to build a personal following.

- He argued that the party needed more nationalist policies to get more support

In February 1920, the DAP was renamed into the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (Nazis)

At the same time, they set out the Nazis’ main beliefs in the 25-point programme.

Nazi’s main beliefs in the 25-point programme:

- Abolition of the Treaty of Versailles
- Anschluss (union) between Germany and Austria
- Only “true” Germans to be allowed to live in Germany.
    - Jews in particular to be excluded
- Generous provision for old-age pensioners
- Nationalisation of large industries and businesses
- Creation of a strong central government
