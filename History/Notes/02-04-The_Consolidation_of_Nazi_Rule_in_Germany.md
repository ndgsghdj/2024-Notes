# The Consolidation of Nazi Rule in Germany

## Background

### Challenges to Hitler as Chancellor

- The Socialist SPD and Communist KPD
    - Were ideologically opposed to Hitler and the Nazis
- The Nazi Party lacked a majority in Reichstag
    - Needed majority to pass laws on its own
- von Papen and the Elites
    - Loyal to Hindenburg
- von Schleicher and the Army
    - Loyal to Hindenburg
- Hindenburg
    - Held more loyalty and respect among the German people

### Determination to Establish a Dictatorship

- Sought to have the Nazi party gain a 2/3 majority in the Reichstag
    - This would allow him to change the constitution and thus grant him dictatorial powers.
- To that end, he called for elections in 1933
    - By this time, the Nazis had control of police, radio stations and most newspapers
    - Held massive rallies
    - Spent a fortune on the Nazi campaign
    - Dismissed officials who opposed Hitler
        - Opponents (e.g. SPD and KPD) had their campaigns disrupted by the SA and SS…
            - Use uniformed followers to break up meetings of other parties and beat up opponents (SA and SS)
            - Extreme Nazi violence throughout the election campaign, especially against the communists.

## Reichstag Fire

On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was burnt down.

- This was in the middle of the campaigning for the 1933 elections
    - Many Germans thought the Nazis were responsible
        - The fire was almost certainly started by the Nazis but the Germans did not know this then
- Hitler claimed that it was started by a lone and mentally unwell communist, Marinus van der Lubbe
    - Hitler declared that it was the start of a communist uprising
    - He thus persuaded Hindenburg to pass an emergency law, the Decree for the Protection of People and State

### The Decree for the Protection of People and State

- Gave Hitler sweeping powers
- Removed freedoms promised by the Weimar Republic
    - Right to a free trial
    - Free press
- The police, SA and SS arrested 4k communists on the night of the fire alone.
- Opposition party meetings, newspapers and radio broadcasts banned.
    - This made it difficult for the opposition to campaign in the 1933 elections
- As a result, the Nazis gained 288 seats
    - With the support of a further 52 DNVP (Deutschnationale Volkspartei / German National People’s Party) delegates, they had a majority (52%) in the Reichstag

## The Enabling Act

Hitler now had a majority

- But not quite the 2/3 majority needed to change the constitution

Hence, he wanted to introduce a new measure called the Enabling Act

- This was aimed to allow him to make and pass laws without consulting the Reichstag

When the Enabling Act came up for a vote, the Nazis employed the following 4 methods to ensure it passed….

1. Used SA and SS to intimidate the Reichstag
2. Banned (and arrested) communist delegates from coming to the Reichstag so they could not vote
3. Persuaded the Central Party to vote for the Act by giving vague promises e.g. not to interfere in Catholic Church/schools
4. Using the votes of his allies

When the Enabling Act came up for a vote, only the SPD voted against it

- The Communists (KPD) were in prison
- The Catholic Centre Party cooperated with the Nazis
- Many delegates did not vote
    - They were injured or intimidated by the SA and SS
- The Enabling Act was passed on 24 March.

With the passing of the Enabling Act, Hitler was not effectively a **dictator**

- For the **next four years,** if he wanted a new law he could pass it without needing to consult the Reichstag or President Hindenburg
- This effectively ended democracy in Germany.

## Gleichschaltung (Coordination)

- A response to how the civil service, judiciary, the army and other groups had undermined the Weimar Republic
- To prevent this and consolidate his power, Hitler introduced the Gleichschaltung (Coordination) process
    - This involved bringing all aspects of the Nazi under Nazi control
- In April 1933, Hitler passed a law which…
    - Banned Jews from civil service
    - Almost impossible to be promoted if not part of the Nazi Party
    - All local councils and state assemblies had to have a Nazi majority
        - Over 400 locally elected council members and 70 locally elected mayors lost their positions
- By July 1933, Hitler passed another law which…
    - Banned all other political parties
    - Germany became a **one-party state**

## The End of Democracy in Germany

- Other factors that signaled the end of democracy in Germany
    - Trade unions taken over by the Nazis
    - Press, radio and cinema placed under total Nazi control
    - Opponents arrested, imprisoned or killed
    - Concentration camps and forced labour camps were opened
    - SS and Gestapo (secret police) struck terror into many Nazi opponents
    - Many fled the country e.g. Albert Einstein and the writer, Thomas Mann

## The Night of the Long Knives

- By 1934, Hitler began to see the SA, particularly its leader, Ernst Röhm, as a threat
    - Röhm was an ally of Hitler
        - Hitler had asked him to lead SA in 1930
    - But by 1933, there was growing tension between them
        - Not given an important role in the new government
- Sources of tension
    - SA was ~3 million strong
        - All of whom were fiercely loyal to Rohm
            - They supported his calls to tax industrialists and landowners to help the unemployed
            - However, these very groups helped Hitler come to power
                - (awkward)
    - Army commanders also suspicious of Rohm
        - They thought the SA was a disreputable force (aka thugs)
        - Unsettled by Rohm’s talk of making the SA into a second German army
- On the weekend of 29-30 June 1934 (the main event)
    - Hitler called the leaders of the SA to a special conference
    - Squads of SS men arrested Rohm and other SA leaders both at the conference and throughout Germany
        - Hitler accused Rohm of plotting to overthrow and murder him
        - Rohm and ~400 were executed.
    - Hitler also targeted his old rivals
        - E.g. von Papen is placed under house arrest
            - Hitler offers him a post as an ambassador to Austria and he accepts, probably a decision that saved his life
- Aftermath
    - No public protests - this demonstrated Hitler’s power and the people’s fear
    - SA was disbanded shortly afterwards
    - Many of its members were absorbed into the army and SS

## The Army and the Oath of Allegiance

- On 2 August 1934, shortly after the Night of Long Knives, Hindenburg died.

**Why was Hindenburg’s Death Important?**

With his death, the only figure who could rival Hitler’s power was gone. In response, Hitler merged the offices of President, Chancellor and the commander in chief of the armed forces and became the Fuehrer (Supreme Leader)

- To further consolidate his power, the oath that all German soldiers swore, was changed to become an oath of personal loyalty to Hitler
    - The army agreed to stay out of politics and to serve him
    - In return, Hitler introduced pro-military policies..
        - He spent vast sums on rearmament
        - Reintroduced conscription
        - Generally made plans to make Germany a great military power again.
