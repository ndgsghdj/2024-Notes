- Reparations
- Territory Changes
- Limit on armed forces/Disarmament
- Formation of League of Nations

### Germany's Reaction

- Saw it as a diktat
- Sources of resentment
    * War Guilt Clause
    * Reparations
    * Territory Changes
    * Limit on armed forces/Disarmament
    * Formation of League of Nations

### Impact of the Treaty of Versailles

    * Hyperinflation in the early 1920s

#### Long Term

- Became a lingering source of resentment

### Impact of other treaties

- Four other treaties were signed at the Paris Peace Conference
    * The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye reinforced the Treaty of Versailles prohibition on *Anschluss*

## Judgments on the Paris Peace Conference and the Treaty of Versailles

### Was the Treaty of Versailles Too Harsh on Germany?

#### Yes

- Disarmament
    * Left it unable to protect itself
- Territorial
    * Brest-Litvosk was harsher to Russia than the TOV was on Germany &rarr; The Big 3 was kinder to Germany than it was to Russia
- War Guilt Clause
    * Unfair because Germany was only responding to Russian mobilisation when it did so at the start of WW1
- Reparations
    * Leads to hyperinflation in 1920s
    * Leads to greater suffering during the Great Depression
- Built resentment towards the Big 3
    * Rise of Hitler

#### No

- Leadership
    * Leadership was not removed/executed/tried &rarr; Experience (especially of military leaders) was retained
- Territorial
    * It is relatively characteristic of treaties of that time
        + But times had changed thanks to ideas like the 14 points and nationalism
            + Germans believed that it was too harsh
    * Germany was not split apart

## League of Nations

### Aims of the League

    * Disarm
    * Bring disputes to the League and accept its decisions
- If a member broke the Covenant
    * Economic sanctions
    * Military action

#### Disarmament

- Aim: to __reduce the ability of countries to wage war__
- To be achieved through international agreements
- E.g. TOV required Germany and her allies to disarm; Allied Powers also required to disarm.

#### Other Aims

- Promote open, fair and honourable relations between nations (prevent alliance systems / secret treaties)
- Lay out system of international law
- Maintain, modify treaties between nations

### Structure of the League

    * Met once annually
- The Council
    * 4 Permanent Members (Britain, France, Italy and Japan)
    * 4 (later 9) temporary members elected by GA

- Collective Security
    * The General Assembly and the Court of Justice worked to solve disputes between nations, to avoid the threat of war. The League also tried to implement a programme of disarmament worldwide.
- The Mandates
    * Special commissions worked to make sure the mandates were properly run.
- Labour issues
    * The ILO advised on working conditions and wages

## Concerns about the League

 - Concerns by Britain and France
     * Lloyd George
         + Wanted a simpler organisation like the Conference of Ambassadors
             + Conference of Ambassadors
                 + Non-League organisation
                 + Informal meeting of the League's permanent members
             + Wanted to maintain Britain's ability to act independent of the League
     *  Clemenceau
         + Also wanted to maintain French independence to act
     *  Ability to achieve disarmament
         + The League expected members to disarm
         + However, this only worked if all members disarmed
         + If not, countries would be left themselves unable to protect their territories and interests
         + Members were thus resistant to disarm.
     *  Ability to stop aggressor countries
         + Peacekeeping Steps
             + A commission of enquiry determines if a nation was guilty of aggression
                 + __Concern:__ Takes time. Time that a country under attack might not have
             + Hold talks with the guilty party (Arbitration and use of moral persuasion)
                 + __Concern:__ Guilty party might not be open to persuasion and/or arbitration
             + League encourages members to impose economic sanctions collectively (thus cutting off trade ad financial relations)
                 + __Concern:__ Members might be concerned of the economic impact on their own countries
             + Take military action to protect them
                 + __Concern:__ The League had no army of its own.
     *  Membership of the League
         + Limited Membership
             + USA did not join because of its non-interventionist policy
                 + The League lacked the USA's economic and military support to enforce its will &rarr; Aggressor countries could continue to trade with US and did not fear one of the strongest militaries in the world
         + Germany denied from joining until 1926
         + USSR denied from joining until 1934
     *  All these thus greatly weakened the League

## Successes and Failures of the League in the 1920s

| Year                              | Incident                                                                  | Resolution                                                                                                                                                                           | Success/Failure |

| 1925 - The Greek Bulgarian Border | Border dispute between Greece and Bulgaria. Greece then invaded Bulgaria. | The LON made Greece withdraw. Britain and France supported the League's decision.                                                                                                    | Success         |
| 1920 - Vilna                      | Poland seized Vilna, the former capital of Lithuania.                     | The League could not make Poland withdraw. Britain and France were reluctant to act.                                                                                                 | Failure         |

| 1921 - Upper Silesia              | Both Germany and Poland wanted   Upper Silesia.                           | The LON let the people of Upper Silesia vote; a huge majority wanted to join Germany. The LON split it into 2 instead.                                                               | Ambiguous       |

## Vilna, 1920

In 1920, Poland took control of Vilna, the Lithuanian capital. Lithuania appealed the League. However, the League could not make Poland withdraw. Britain and France were reluctant to act because Poland was a potential ally against Germany.
# Attempts at Keeping Peace - League of Nations

## Upper Silesia, 1921

In 1921, a dispute broke out between Germany and Poland over Upper Silesia. To solve the problem, the League oversaw a peaceful vote and divided the region between Germany and Poland.
# Attempts at Keeping Peace - League of Nations

## The Greek Bulgarian Border, 1925

In October 1925, some Greek soldiers were killed on Greece's border with Bulgaria. When Greek troops invaded, Bulgaria appealed to the League for help. The League demanded both sides to stand down and told Greece to withdraw. Britain and France supported the League's judgement. Greece obeyed, but pointed out that there seemeed seemed to be one rule for large states such as Italy and another for smaller ones such as itself. The outcome was seen as a major success for the League, and optimism about its effectiveness soared.
# Attempts at Keeping Peace - League of Nations

## Corfu, 1923

One of the borders that had to be decided after the war was between Albania and Greece. The Conference of Ambassadors was given this task. Three Italian officials were killed while surveying the Greek side of the frontier area. Italian leader Benito Mussolini blamed the Greeks, demanded compensation, and attacked and ocupied the Greek island of Corfu. Greece appealed to the League for help but Mussolini insisted that this dispute should be resolved by the Conference of Ambassadors, not the League. The British wanted to stand up to Mussolini. However, the French was involved in a disp;ute with Germany in the Ruhr region over reparations and did not want a dispute with Italy as well.

In the end, Mussolini got his way. The Conference of Ambassadors ruled that the Greeks must apologise and pay compensation directly to Italy. if Britain and France had stood together, Mussolini would probably not have gotten his way.
