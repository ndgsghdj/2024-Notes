# Impact of the Great Depression

## Background

- In 1923 - 1929, the Weimar Republic enjoyed a golden age
- However, in October 1929, the US economy crashed. As a result..
    - US bankers and businessmen asked German banks to repay their loans and removed their investments in Germany
    - This results in economic collapse in Germany
        - Businesses went bankrupt
        - Unemployment skyrocketed

By 1932, unemployment was at 6 million or 40% of the population. 

- Most of society was affected

Many small businesses went bankrupt

Between 1929 - 1932: The income of the average Germany fell by 40%

- This led to hunger and illness
- Many germans could not pay rent
    - Many were evicted from their homes
- Makeshift shelters and slums appeared in most cities.
- When the crisis struck in October 1929, Germany was ruled by a coalition government led by the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany)
    - They wanted to increase welfare for the unemployed
    - Their coalition partners refused
    - The coalition government collapsed in 1930
- President Hindenberg used Article 48 to appoint Heinrich Brüning as the new chancellor
    - Cut spending on welfare
    - Cut wages of civil servants and most government employees
    - Could not get Reichstag approval
    - Had to get Hindenberg to use emergency powers to get it passed
- From this point, the Weimar Republic effectively failed
    - The parties were so divided it was impossible to form a coalition with a majority in the Reichstag
    - Hindenberg ruled by decree as he was forced to use Article 48 to…
        - Decide who became chancellor
        - Pass laws

## The Rise in Communism

Many workers began to feel that the Weimar Republic was not managing the economic crisis well and failed them

- The political parties
    - Seemed to care more about their own positions
    - Were unable to gain a majority in the Reichstag and get welfare measures passed

Hindenburg ruled the country by decree and supported Brüning.

- This had a devastating impact on millions of ordinary Germans
- To the extent, Brüning became called the “hunger chancellor”

Some have turned towards the Nazi Party.

Most have turned towards the German Communist Party (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands / KPD)

- They had rebuilt their organisation during the 1920s.
    - They had local party branches, a youth party movement and a very effective publicity machine.

Between 1929 - 1932, ~1 million workers turned towards the KPD.

- Reichstag representation rose from 10% to 15%.

The rise of communists frightened many Germans

- Business leaders
    - Feared the communists would seize control of their businesses
    - They were also concerned about the growing strength of the trade unions
- Middle Class
    - Communists were hostile to their class
- Landowners
    - Feared the communists would seize their land, kill and imprison them.
- All of which were what the communists did in the USSR when they came to power.

Many Germans turned to the Nazi Party

- Because they seemed willing and able to take control of the situation and face the communists

## Growth in Support for the Nazis

While the communists gained supporters from the economic crisis, the Nazis gained even more

- By 1933, membership rose to >800,000
- In the 1930 elections, the Nazi got 107 seats

This was due to a number of factors

1. The Hitler Factor
    1. He was a powerful and persuasive speaker
    2. His profile was raised by his failed presidential campaign against Hindenburg in 1932.
    3. He was able to spread his message to millions of people

        2. He travelled by plane on a hectic tour of rallies across Germany
    4. He appeared to be a dynamic man of the moment / the leader of a modern party with modern ideas
2. Use of Propaganda
    1. Joseph Goebbels, who was in charge of Nazi propaganda by 1929, exploited the effects of the Depression
        1. Leaflets, newspapers and radio broadcasts
            1. Blamed…
                1. The problems on the TOV, particularly the reparations
                2. The Weimar politicians for being too selfish and divided to do what is needed to get people back to work
            2. Promised…
                1. Rebuild the German military which would create millions of jobs
                2. Sympathy and support for workers (in the Nazi 25 points)
            3. Offered…
                1. Culprits to blame for the problems, particularly the Jews.

        3. Return to traditional German values
        4. Fight the communists (in elections, in the Reichstag, and on the streets, etc.)
    3. These appealed to Germans as they addressed their fears

            1. Wealthy industrialists provided funds
            2. They, middle class and rural Germans started voting for the Nazis
3. The SA and the SS
    1. At the time, there were frequent street battles
