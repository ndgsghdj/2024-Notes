## The TOV Was Too Harsh on Germany

### American Aims at the Paris Peace Conference

#### Example and Explanation

America was represented at the Paris Peace Conference by its president, Woodrow Wilson. He advocated for self-determination, the idea that nations should rule themselves rather than be ruled by others. This led to the different Eastern European peoples, such as the Poles, Czechs, and Slovaks, gaining their own nations. __(Example 1)__ However, this concept was not implemented in reference to Germany. It was divided into two parts, the first being the creation of a "Polish Corridor" to allow the newly-formed Poland to have access to the sea. __(Example 2)__

#### Link

This failure to apply Wilson's concept of self-determination to Germany despite it being applied to its neighbors demonstrated how the Treaty was too harsh on Germany.

### War Guilt Clause

#### Example and Explanation

The treaty included what was called the War Guilt Clause. This directly blamed the Germans for starting World War I. Most Germans did not think this was fair, as they believed that all the nations shared the blame for the war. __(Example 1)__ Germany did not start the war and was simply involved in a colonial, naval, and economic power struggle with other Great Powers. Germany entered the war to protect its ally, Austria-Hungary. __(Example 2)__

#### Link

Thus, they felt it was unfair that the other nations said the war was Germany's fault and saw the treaty as unjust and hated it, and those politicians who signed it were called the 'November Criminals'. Thus, the Treaty was too harsh on Germany.

### Disarmament

#### Example and Explanation

German forces had to be reduced to well below pre-war levels. Its army was limited to 100,000 men. __(Example 1)__ It was not allowed to have any armored vehicles, submarines, or aircraft. __(Example 2)__ Its navy was reduced to only six battleships. __(Example 3)__ Furthermore, the border area between Germany and France, the Rhineland, was demilitarised, so no German forces or fortifications were allowed there. __(Example 4)__

#### Link

This was a major blow to Germany, where its army was a symbol of its national pride, particularly as none of the Allies were disarmed to the same extent. The disarmament also made it difficult for Germany to defend itself effectively. Thus, the Treaty was too harsh on Germany.

### German Territories

#### Example and Explanation

It saw all of Germany's colonies taken away, which was a blow to its pride at a time when owning colonies was a sign of importance. __(Example 1)__ Furthermore, the disputed territories of Alsace and Lorraine were restored to France. __(Example 2)__ What was even more difficult for the Germans to accept was that Germany was divided in two by the creation of a "Polish Corridor" to allow the newly-formed Poland to have access to the sea. __(Example 3)__

#### Link

All these losses created huge resentment in a proud country like Germany, and thus, the Treaty was too harsh.

### Reparations

#### Example and Explanation

Germany had to pay 6.6 billion pounds as reparations to the Allies for war damage. __(Example 1)__ Already faced with huge debts from the war effort, Germany was forced to print money to make reparation payments. This led to hyperinflation in the 1920s, when prices shot up, and German money became worthless.

#### Link

Reparations imposed by the Treaty thus led to economic hardship and poverty for the German people. Thus, the Treaty was too harsh.

### The League of Nations

#### Example and Explanation

The League of Nations was set up as an international body to help countries resolve disputes and, if necessary, enforce decisions. However, Germany was not allowed to join by the Treaty. __(Example 1)__ It was only allowed to join in 1926. __(Example 2)__

#### Link

By refusing to allow Germany into the League of Nations, the Treaty effectively barred it as a fully recognised member of the international community. Thus, the Treaty was too harsh.

## The Treaty of Versailles Was Not Too Harsh on Germany

### British Aims at the Paris Peace Conference

#### Example and Explanation

Britain was represented at the Paris Peace Conference by its Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. Before the war, Germany was Britain's second-largest trading market after the war. Thus, to rebuild Britain's economic prosperity, he sought to enable Germany's economic recovery after the war. __(Example 1)__ Furthermore, at the time of the conference, the Russian Empire had collapsed, and it was in the middle of a bitter civil war between the communist Bolsheviks and anti-communist forces. Lloyd George was worried that if the Bolsheviks won the civil war, Russia would emerge as a strong power and try to spread communist beliefs through revolution or war. He thus wanted Germany to recover economically and act as a buffer against the rise of communism in Europe. __(Example 2)__

#### Link

As a result, Lloyd George moderated the Treaty's terms, reducing its severity. Thus, the Treaty was not too harsh.

### French Aims at the Paris Peace Conference

#### Example and Explanation

France was represented at the Paris Peace Conference by its Prime Minister, Georges Clemenceau. France had suffered enormous damage during WWI. Large stretches of northern France had been invaded, and there were 1.7 million deaths, with many more wounded and missing. __(Example 1)__ At the same time, Clemenceau was concerned about Germany's threat to France. Germany had a younger and larger population of 65 million compared to France's 40 million. This meant Germany would be able to use its people to fight a future war. __(Example 2)__ Furthermore, as there had been no fighting in German territories, its industrial regions were not damaged. This would allow Germany's economy to recover more quickly than France's. __(Example 3)__

#### Link

Thus, the Treaty's terms were not too harsh because it is understandable that they wished to punish Germany after France's hardships in World War I.

### The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk

#### Example and Explanation

In March 1918, Germany had forced Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. As part of this Treaty, Russia was forced to give Germany large amounts of land, such as Finland and Ukraine, which included large areas of prime agricultural land, industrial areas, and much of its population and resources, such as oil and iron stores. __(Example 2)__ In addition, Russia was required to pay 6 billion marks in reparations to Germany. __(Example 3)__

#### Link

In light of the harshness of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that Germany had imposed on Russia during World War I, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles cannot be said to be too harsh.

### Public Sentiments of the Allies in 1919

#### Example and Explanation

After World War I, the people of Britain, France, and the United States felt strongly that Germany was responsible for the war and should be punished. This sentiment was particularly strong in Britain and France, as the total casualties on both sides, killed or injured, were estimated to exceed nine million. __(Example 1)__ Civilians also faced food and medicine shortages, while villages and towns in large areas of Belgium and France had been devastated __(Example 2)__

#### Link

To the people of Britain and France, there was no question that the treaty with Germany should be harsh. Thus, the treaty was not too harsh on Germany.
