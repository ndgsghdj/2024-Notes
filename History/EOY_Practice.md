### How similar..

Both sources are similar in showing that Hitler had outstanding personal abilities that led to the rise of the Nazi Party. According to Source D, Hitler had an “undeniable political instinct that sized up the German audience with astonishing accuracy, bringing him to the top of the tree.” This suggests that Hitler’s rise to power was due to his own leadership abilities, as his political skill and talent in reading the crowd explained his huge popularity. SImilarly, in Source E, “every word dropped by Hitler seemed like an inspired word from heaven,” explaining his huge popularity where “thirty thousand hands raised in salute” when welcoming his arrival.

Both sources differ in whether Hitler used falsehoods to gain support. Source D says that Hitler did not, while Source E says that Hitler did. Source D states that Hitler did not use falsehoods to gain popularity. Instead, he used “repetitions of a few simple main ideas, where everyday ideas are uttered with such extraordinary emphasis that an uninformed audience mistakes them for newly invented political theories” in his speeches. In contrast, Source E describes Hitler’s speeches as “inspired word from heaven, every lie pronounced was accepted as high truth itself.” Thus, the sources are different in their view on whether Hitler needed to rely on falsehoods to gain the support of the German people.

**Purpose (Max Marks - Similarity OR Difference in content plus)**

Both sources D and E are similar in purpose. In Source D, the British Foreign Ministry member (Author) was trying to inform (Action Word) the British government (Audience) that Hitler rose to power due to his own ability (Aim/message). This is reflected in the source, which states that he had “an undeniable political instinct have brought him to the top of the tree”. From this evidence, it shows how it was through his own actions and political acumen that Hitler managed to be the leader of Germany. In showing this, the author probably wanted the British government to know more about Hitler’s capacility and be wary of him in the future (Anticipated outcome).

Similarly, the American journalist (Author) in Source E was also trying to inform (Actionw ord) his own audience, the American public (Audience), that Hitler rose to power due to his own ability (Aim/message). This is shown in source E where it states “ever word dropped by Hitler seemed like an inspired word from heaven”. From this evidence, itr shows that Hitler was able to influence the Germans to support him due to his being a great orator

### Evaluation

**Yes**

Yes, Source A shows that favourable cricumstances was the main reason explaining Hitler’s rise to power, as it identified the Great Depression as the key reason for the rise of Hitler. This can be seen in the source, which states that “Germany during the Great Depression was demoralized and disorganized. … The German people wanted a way out of its economic mess and its cultural shame. [And thus][b]y 1933, Hitler was viewed by many as the only man who could halt the rapid slide towards economic and political turmoil.” This shows that it was as a result of the impact of the Great Depression on the German people that GHitler gained the support he needed to rise to power. 

Yes, Source C suggesets that favourable circumstances was the main reason explaining Hitler’s rise to power, as it claims that Hitler rose to power becuase of the economic troubles Germany faced. Source C shows Germans who look unhappy, accompanied by a slogan on the poster that reads “Our Last Hope-Hitler” This means that Hitler would be able to provide solutions to economic sufferings of the people, thus he rose to power not through his own ability but by exploiting Germany’s economic turmoil.

**No**

No, Source B shows that Hitler’s own abilities was the main reason explaining Hitler’s rise to power, as it explains that Hitler’s talent for striking a chord with his audience accounts for his rise to power. This can be seen in the source which states that Hitler “had a deep insight into the collective emotions of the crowds and was highly-skilled at keeping his message to them simple, striking and memorable.” This shows that it was Hitler’s charisma that helped him rise to power.

No, Source D suggests that Hitler’s own abilities was the main reason explaining Hitler’s rise to power, as it implies that it was his excellent crowd manipulation that explained his rise to power. This can be seen in the source which states that “Hitler exercises an astonishing sway over a German audience” and how this “brought him to the top of the tree.” The source thus indicates that it was Hitler

**Bonus**

Source A is supported by my contextual knowledge, which tells me that the Great Depression did lead to significant hardship within Germany. Due to its impact, by 1932, unemployment was at six million, or 40 percent of the workforce. As a result, many Germans began supporting the radical parties such as the Nazi party which offered new solutions to their difficulties, such that by 1930, the Nazis won 107 seats and 800,000 members. Thus, as source A is supported by contextual knowledge, it is reliable.
