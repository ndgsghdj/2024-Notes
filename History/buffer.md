## The Greek Bulgarian Border, 1925

In October 1925, some Greek soldiers were killed on Greece's border with Bulgaria. When Greek troops invaded, Bulgaria appealed to the League for help. The League demanded both sides stand down and told Greece to withdraw. Britain and France supported the League's judgement. Greece obeyed, but pointed out that there seemed to be one rule for large states such as Italy and another for smaller ones such as itself. The outcome was seen as a major success for the League, and optimism about its effectiveness soared.

## Proportional Representation

Thanks to the Weimar Constitution, the Weimar Republic operated under a system known as proportional representation where people voted for a party rather than specific candidates and parties gained seats based on the number of votes won.

The Weimar Constitution required that all laws be approved by the Reichstag.

- Proportional representation made it hard for any political party to get a majority during elections. Hence, coalition governments were formed.
    * __For example,__ Friedrich' Ebert's Social Democratic Party won the most votes and gained the most seats in the Reichstag following the January 1919 elections and he became president. However, he did not have enough seats to forma  government on his own and had to form a coalition with the Catholic Centre Party and the German Democratic Party.
