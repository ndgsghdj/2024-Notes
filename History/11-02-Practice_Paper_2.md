### Model Answer

I agree that Germans hated the Treaty of Versailles because it blamed them for starting World War 1. The Treaty included what was called the War Guilt Clause. This directly blamed the Germans for starting World War 1. Most Germans did not think this was fair, as they believed that all nations shared the blame for the war. (Example 1) Germany did not start the war and was simply involved in a colonial, naval

The Germans also hated the Treaty because it took away significant areas of land from Germany. It saw all of Germany's colonies taken away, which was a blow to its pride at a time when owning colonies was a sign of importance. (Example 1) Furthermore, the disputed territories of Alsace and Lorraine were restored to France. (Example 2) What was even more difficult

However, I think the War Guilt Clause was the most important of all the reasons why Germans hated the Treaty, and this was because the Allies used it as justification for all the other punishments. It was the justification for taking land from Germany. As all the punishments were based on what the Germans saw as the false accusation that they were to blame for the war, the War Guilt Clause was central to the Germans' hatred of the Treaty.
