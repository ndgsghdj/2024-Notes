# Practice Paper 3

## Q1(a) Study Source A. What was the purpose of this speech? Explain your answer.

The public speech was written by Marshall to convince the media that the Marshall Plan is solely to provide support and aid to countries affected by WW2. The source states that "It is logical that the United States should do whatever it can to help countries restore their damaged economies. Only then can we be sure there will be peace and political stability. We are not introducing our policy to counter any particular political belief. Instead we are acting against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos." Hence, Marshall attempts to convey the message that the Marshall Plan is solely for humanitarian purposes, seeking to rehabilitate the living conditions and economies of deeply affected countries, and does not carry ulterior motives to gain political influence in the regions they aim to offer help to. Hence, it is anticipated that the media will paint the Marshall Plan in a more benevolent light, minimising focus on the potential political benefits that the USA will gain from the implementation of the Marshall Plan.

## Q1(b) Study Source B. What is the message of this cartoon? Explain your answer.

The message of the cartoon is that the USA does not intend to help Western Europe recover fully from the impacts of WW2 with the Marshall Plan. The cartoon depicts Marshall attempting to lift a large pillar of support, labelled "American Aid", over to a house about to fall apart, labelled "Western Europe". However, a man donning a top hat and jacket, depicting the USA, is sitting on the pillar, preventing it from being lifted up fully. This shows that the USA does not fully support the pure goal of the Marshall Plan, which is to provide extensive support to the deeply affected economies of the nations in Western Europe. While Marshall attempts to implement the plan and provide full American aid to the nations, he is prevented from doing so due to conflicting interests of the American government in Western Europe.
