## Chapter 2 Review

### Weak Constitution of the Weimar Republic: Proportional Representation

Thanks to the Weimar Constitution, the Weimar Republic operated under a system known as proportional representation, where people voted for a party rather than specific candidates, and parties gained seats based on the number of votes won. (Example 1.1) The proportional representation made it hard for any political party to get a majority during elections. Hence, coalition governments were formed. For example, Friedrich Ebert's Social Democratic Party won the most votes and gained the most seats

### Unpopularity of the Weimar Republic with the People

The majority of the Germans behind the German army ended WW1 undefeated. They were not told if the war continued that Germany would be invaded

### Threat to the Republic - Left-Wing

Early in 1919, communists with similar beliefs as the Russian Bolsheviks, known as the Spartacists, staged a revolt. (Example 1.1) They were joined by rebel soldiers and sailors and were able to set up soviets in many towns. (Example 1.2) Ultimately, it took a combination of the army and the anti-communist band of WW1 veterans known as the Freikorps to put down the rebellion (Example 2)

### Threat to the Republic - Right Wing

On March 1920, Wolfgang Kapp led 5,000 Freikorps into Berlin. He planned to overthrow the Weimar Republic and install a more authoritarian system. The German army refused to act. Germanyâ€™s trade unions declared a general strike and civil servants refused to cooperate with Kapp. This forced Kapp to give up, and Kapp was hunted down after he fled the country but died while awaiting trial. However, besides Kapp, no other rebels were punished.

### Hyperinflation in the 1920s

In the 1920s, the German government continued to print banknotes, causing them to become worthless as hyperinflation set in. As a result, prices of daily needs rose rapidly. For example, the price of a loaf of bread in 1923 could have bought a house in 1921 (Example 1). It affected the middle class most harshly by how it wiped out savings and high rates of unemployment. It was ultimately resolved by the new German Chancellor, Gustav Stresemann, who negotiated the reorganisation of reparations in the 1924 Dawes Plan and the 1929 Young Plan. (Example 2) In November 1925, he replaced the German mark with the Rentenmark. (Example 3) These measures reduced German debt and ended hyperinflation.

### The Great Depression

In October 1929, the US economy crashed. As a result, US bankers and businessmen asked Germans plans to repay their loans and removed their investments in Germany. This resulted in economic collapse in Germany as businesses went bankrupt and unemployment

### The Death of Hindenburg

On 2 August 1934, shortly after the Night of the Long Knives, Hindenburg died. With his death, the only figure who could rival Hitler's power was gone. In response, Hitler merged the offices of president, chancellor and the commander in chief of the armed forces and became the Fuhrer (Supreme Leader).
