# Practice Paper 1: Feedback

## Q1(a) [5m] - Inference

Level Average = 2.62.
- Most failed to identify context (only one person did)
- This was an inference question, not a message question (should have provided 2 inferences if there was time) > Generally not an issue as such questions are rare
- High level of lifting (e.g. "military power")
- Weak explanations, hence generally L3/3
- Several misinterpreted the source to be a test for China/Korea.

> This source tells me that the Korean War was a success for China as it enhanced its international reputation. This can be seen from the source, which states that China joined the Korean War "to prove to the West that China was now a military power and would use force to vindicate its interests". This improved its standing among other countries, demonstrating it could stand up for its interests through military right

__OR__

> This source also tells me that the Korean War was a turning point in the history of China as it debunked the myth of Western superiority. This can be seen from the source, which states that Mao "had gone to war to test the "New China" with a trial by fire and to purge what [he] perceived as China's historic softness and passivity" and to 

### Context

> This is supported by my contextual knowledge, which tells me that the Chinese involvement in the Korea War established the People's Republic as a major power to be contended with, as demonstrated by its place at the negotiations for the Korean Armistice Agreement alongside other major powers such as the Soviet Union and the United States. As such, the Korean War was a turning point in the history of China.

## Q1(b) [5m] - Purpose

Level Average = 3.5
- Most failed to identify context
- Excessive repetition of anticipated outcome.
- Message often came only in explanation of source content (unsafe as missing it, generally = L1/1)
- Some did not get L4/4 (purpose level) because they left out the __Author__.
- Author must come with Message, Anticipated Outcome is important (Have all 5As)

### L5 w/ Context

> Source B was published by the Allies (Author) to convince (Action word) the Chinese (Audience) that Stalin had manipulated China into fighting the Korean War (Aim/Message). This was distributed to the Chinese soldiers in April 1953 when the war had become a stalemate (Context) and was in the hope that they would pressure the Chinese government to stop being a puppet of Stalin and cease China's involvement in the Korean War, thus giving the Allied Powers an upper hand in the war. (Anticipated Outcome). This can be seen in Source B, which shows that Mao and his counterparts are portrayed as puppets being controlled by Stalin and his advisors. This implies that China had no say in its involvement in the Korean War but was being led by the USSR into it.

## Q1c. [6m] - Reliability (Prove)

Level Average = 3.02
- Many misinterpreted Source D for the purposes of cross-reference (saw defence of North Korea as defence of China instead)
- Many did not identify Message of Source C (base source) (Repeating the question i.e. joined the war for humanitarian reasons IS NOT the message) until explanation
- Some had missing or incomplete logic sentences for their cross-reference
- Many misinterpreted Source D for the purposes of cross-reference (saw defence of North Korea as defence of China instead)Many did not identify Message of Source C (base source) (Repeating the question i.e. joined the war for humanitarian reasons IS NOT the message) until explanation. 
- Some had missing or incomplete logic sentences for their cross-references
- Many left the question undone or incomplete (Time Management Issue)
- Many referenced "The East" rather than North Korea.

## Q1(d) [6m] - Surprise (2 Sources)

Level Average = 1.23
- Most left the question undone or incomplete (Time Management Issue) > To save time, indicate BoC first to secure L2/2 then move on (not only indicate BoC after evidence)

### L2

> The source proves that China's involvement in the Korean War was for humanitarian reasons as China wanted to protect North Korea from the USA by offering her military assistance. This can be seen as it states that "[w]e decided to send volunteers under the name of the first military troops to the North Korean interior in order to help the North Korean comrades." This shows that the Chinese involvement was motivated by their humanitarian desire to assist their fellow North Korean comrades.

### L3

> L2 + This source is contradicted by Source E, which states that China's involvement in the Korean War was not for humanitarian reasons as China had done so to protect her national interests. This can be seen as it states that 

> L2 + 

### L4

Both elements of L3

### L5

> The source is unreliable due to its provenance as an official statement by Mao (Author) to other countries (Audience) that aimed to convince (Action Word) them to support China in its conflict with the USA in the Korean War so as to secure its security (Anticipated Outcome). If the USA were to take over the whole of Korea, China's national interest woul dbe at stake as the USA could then leverage on Korea and invade China (Aim/Message). Due to its 

> Having read Source E, I am surprised by Source D as they differ in terms of the motivation for China's involvement in the Korean War. Source D states that China was involved in the Korean War to protect North Korea. This can be seen in the source, which shows that the Chinese soldier in the poster represented China fighting for North Korea against the USA

> Having read Source E, I am not surprised by Source D as they were similar in that the Chinese involvement in the Korean War was motivated by a desire to fight the Americans. Source D shows that the Chinese soldier in the poster represented China fighting for North Korea against the USA as part of the Chinese "Resist Americans, Support Korea" campaign. This demonstrates that the reason that the Chinese became involved in the Korean War was to fight against the Americans in defense of the North Korean people.
> Furthermore, Source D is also supported by Source C in that the Chinese involvement in the Korean War was motivated by a desire to fight the Americans. This can be seen in Source C, which states that Chinese "decided"

## Q1(e)

- Do not repeat the same message for different sources.

### Yes

> Source C supports the view becaause it states that China provided military assistance to North korea to oppose the USA. This can be in the source, which states, "[w]e decided to send volunteers under the name of the first military troops to the North Korean interior in order to fight against the "
