# What caused the failure  of Japan's democracy in the 1930s?

## Inflation and Unemployment in the 1920s

- By the early 1920s, severe inflation set in and made Japanese goods very expensive.
- Examples
    * Rice increased 174% in price
    * These issues were worsened by the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake as the destruction it caused.
- There was high unemployment as a result of layoffs resulting from a decline in demand for Japanese goods.

## 1927 Banking Crisis

- In 1927, there was a widespread panic that the Japanese banks did not have enough money to cover deposits due to bad debts.
    * In response, 

## The Great Depression, 1929

## The London Naval Conference, 1930

- In 1922, Japan signed agreements with Britain, France and the USA at the Washington Naval Conference to limit total number of warships built.
    * Compared to the Western powers, Japan was restricted to a smaller fleet
        + The countries agreed to the ratio for warship tonnage to be:
            + United States: 10
            + Britain: 10
            + Japan: 7
        + Japan was forced to sign the new London Naval Treaty of 1930 as Japan was not ready to confront the Western powers.
        + Several Cabinet ministers refused to agree to the Treaty and resigned in protest.
            + Was presented in the press (newspapers, radio, etc) and navy commanders as a betrayal by the government.

## Invasion of Manchuria, 1931

- In September 1931, the Kwantung Army blew up a section of the railway at Mukden
    * They blamed it on the Chinese government and used it as an excuse to take over Manchuria
    * By December, the Kwantung Army was in control of most of the region
    * In March 1932, the Japanese renamed it to Manchukuo
        + It was theoretically independent. However, it was in practice a Japanese colony.
    * Military in Japan supported the Kwantung Army's actions
        + Civilian government could do nothing.

## May 15 Incident - Assassination of Prime Minister Inukai, 1932

- On 29 May 1932, the Emperor appointed a navy admiral as Japan's new PM
    * His Cabinet had 15 members
    * Only 5 elected civilian party representatives
    * The remaining 10 were military officers and government official
    * This effectively brought Japan under militarist rule.

## 26 February 1936 Coup

- A group of young officers from the revolutionist "Imperial Way" faction of the army unsuccessfully tried to instigate a military coup and assassinate key government leaders. The failure allowed the army's conservative "Control" faction to seize control of the military and reunify it as a cohesive political force.
- The military  leadership was able to regain control over most of its  soldiers and officers, increasing their strength. The new strength of the military leadership over the cabinet allowed them to appoint and active general as the Minister of War, a previously civilian post.
- The conservative military leadership now had more direct power in the Cabinet and influence over the  remaining government, which enabled them to holistically shape Japan for war. Therefore, it impacted Japan politically.

## Japan's Industrialisation

- New industrialisation efforts shifted the emphasis from consumer industries to heavy industries that would promote self-sufficiency while increasing the production of military goods. It also encouraged the construction of infrastructure projects like roads, railways and bridges.
- The military leadership's strong and generous support for these new productions led to the emergence of new zaibatsus, such as Nissan, Nichitsu, and Mori, that were closely allied with the military government. The close cooperation ensured that the military had key resources, production facilities, and the capability to exploit the raw resources of Korea and Manchuria.
- This impacted Japan economically as the dominance of pro-militarist Zaibatsus meant that Japan's economy was repurposed for war preparation while under increased state control.

## Formation of Cartels

- To minimize competition between the zaibatsus, the military government implemented the Principal Industries Control Law of 1931 which allowed zaibatsus to form cartels. These cartels limit competition by regulating price and production share across the industry. Soon, the government would play a direct role in influencing these cartels.
- The virtual elimination of competition from key heavy industries created an environment that was more conducive for the military government’s goal to coordinate and direct economic activity in Japan. The cartels created a platform for the military government to later control the production activities of wartime industries. For example, in 1936, the officials and military commanders in the Cabinet brought the electric power industry under direct government control. By 1937, the government introduced the Five-Year Plans setting targets for production in various industries.
- With the military’s direct intervention in cartels, the military leadership had gained a virtual monopoly over production and resource extraction across the growing Japanese empire.

## Increased Control of Labour Unions

- In 1936, the military government began to oppose labor unions; thousands of workers were forced to withdraw from government employee unions.
- Workers in Japan were less able to negotiate or campaign for more favorable working conditions or contracts; the military government now could more easily ‘silence’ the country’s economic manpower.
- Besides increasing government control over the economy, the opposition towards labour unions led to a repression of individual rights in Japan. Society had less avenues to oppose the imposition of the military government’s values and goals onto them.

## Campaign for Economic Revitalisation

- This initiative was a mix of propaganda and practical proposals to improve the crop yield in rural areas while increasing the incomes of farmers
- The initiative was successful in addressing the agricultural issues that hindered Japan’s industrialisation, therefore enabling the military government to better manage resources and production. 
- Moreover, the success of the campaign helped to increase the military government’s popularity with the rural population, especially with the campaign espousing the merit of reviving traditional values. This enabled the government’s values and goals to be more deeply entrenched among the farmers.
- The success of the campaign increased the political influence of the military government over the rural countryside in Japan. Furthermore, the improvement of the farmer’s situations helped to improve the social stability and cohesion in rural society.
