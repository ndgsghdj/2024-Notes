World Disarmament Conference, 1932–1934, "The Conference was convened to deal with the issue of limiting offensive weapons and Germany. This was in response to the concerns over the increasing tensions in the world. The United States and almost 60 other states attended the Conference held at the League's headquarters. The Conference failed to come to any agreement over disarmament. Nations such as France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia refused to disarm due to fears of a potential German invasion. Other powers refused to disarm to the same level that Germany faced under the Treaty of Versailles. Conversely, many nations present were also reluctant to agree to German rearmament. Germany withdrew from the League of Nations while the Conference was ongoing. The deadlock in negotiations showed that nations were more keen on putting their national interests ahead of world disarmament and collective security, thereby undermining the credibility of the League of Nations."

The failure of the League to encourage disarmament and collective security damaged its credibility. The Conference also showed that France and Britain's interests were not fully aligned. Britain's refusal to put down guarantees for France's security further caused a lack of trust. "

As a result, Hitler was convinced that the League would not be able to hinder Germany’s plan of expansion. "
